This first collaboration will gather experts from the global fablab network who already align with the SDGs together with new comers willing to align their fablab programs with the SDGs. For this very first session at the GENEVA FORUM 2019, the FAB SDGs Working Group will focus on detecting existing and robust programs that already align with the SDGs through an anticipated call for contribution to fablabs. This call will also give new comers the opportunity to expose new programs and activities - even the most disruptive ones - aligning with the SDGs.

During the GENEVA FORUM 2019 - taking place at the UN Headquarter in Geneva-, we will discuss the panel of strategies to support, to distribute, and to bring the most advanced fablab activities, programs and peoples to align with the SDGs at a global scale, to promote the alignment between the Open Science Practices and the SDGs.

A Group starts the publication draft- all those participating get a link.

The group then submits this to the peer review pool, along with key phrases or subject areas attached- for automatic processing- and submission to an open Peer review page on the JOGL website.
Members of JOGL with the publications. affiliated phrases or interests in their special peer review interests section, or who have published with similar phrases- will get a notification or chance of notification to edit the work-  however- a section of the website is dedicated to peer review and anyone can review the work.

To ensure this is high to begin. with, proof of professorship- or imported impact score from research gate or google gives a head start- meaning initially those who already review can immediately continue reviewing.

232,For all the people at the sprint. I'm terribly sorry about the poor internet connection on my side. The wifi where I was didnt have the best signal. Please have a look at the source code shared on github and especially the 'app.py' file in the repository to see how vader was utilized for sentiment anlaysis. The function 'preprocess NLTk' defines the steps that are used to carry out the analysis on the twitter data before feeding it to dash for visualization.,28,William Kane,Olwit,2019-11-07T18:20:47.493Z
233,"An update on overcoming the hurdle of getting twitter developer access:
The twitter developer access may be present a hurdle in accessing tweets for NLP analysis. The second dashboard, therefore,  bypasses the need for the Twitter API by using an OSINT tool for python called TWINT. 
You can access the dashboard here and interact with it actively to change the different parameters and see the changes.

Using the Vader algorithm, we're writing a Python file that reads the tweets from the file shared here, translates them to English in case they're written in any other language, then gets the average compound score of ""positivity"" of these tweets to find the percentage of people's enthusiasm about certain products.
We'll share the file in a few moments, after the Focus Group. ",408,Enzo,MULLER,2019-11-07T19:37:53.944Z

A quick update on the progress of this project.
What did we do: 
- We collected data from several open data deposits
- Created a method to calculate and visualise the country risk score

What is next:
- Cleaning the data
- Calculating the index
- Combining the indices to a grouped score
- Calculating the country score with the grouped scores

Outlook:
- a web interface where visitors can see the global risk for vaccination and by selecting a country the composite of the score

This is in short what we have been up to, and I hope that can tell more in the next weeks about our progress with the tasks. Your suggestions, remarks, feedback, and questions are more than welcome to improve the project.

Cheers,
Gijs

260,"Hi All,
It always takes a bit of time to design a process to clean and reformat the data you are planning to use in a project [suggestions are always welcome].

The process I am going to follow will look like this:
1) Find the correct ISO3 country code* for each row in the data
2) Use only the rows in the data which match the country list
3) Mark the rows with no data, and calculate basic statistics for the other rows
4) Create a fuzzy function over the min and max values
5) Apply the function, so that there is a fuzziness between 0 and 1
6) Assign a default value, either close to 0 or 1, to the rows with no data

I hope to process a few datasets over the next days to test this process.

Cheers,

276,"Hi All,
The first phase of this little project is over, which I have treated as a Proof of Concept [PoC], and it looks like that with the help of experts and a bit more of work the method could be used on a larger scale. I will use the documentation to explain this in a bit more detail, and I hope we can work on this in the next phase.

The attached EXCEL file [FuzzyCal_v1.xlsx] contains the processed data I processed so far, important tabs are:
- SheetList:                   listing all the sheets in the file
- WorldCountryList:    combining all data to the country
- Export:                        the cleaned list to be joined to the map 
- RiskScoring:              the risk calculations based on three aspects

The other EXCEL file is an example of how the raw data is fuzzified to an interval [0-1], the tab Functions show the fuzzy relationship used in this process; all other datasets have followed the same process.

Next is a little python coding to create a Jupyter Notebook to bind the Export Sheet to a dynamic map and create the triangle on the fly.

As always, questions and comments are more than welcome.

Cheers,
Gijs


Ps. If I would create a Jupyter Notebook, how can I make the Notebook available, through the git repository?",218,Gijs,Van den Dool,2019-11-30T15:20:31.502Z

303,"Approach: You guys have a solid problem statement and methodology that directly address the issue! Did you consider also incorporating 'google trends'? At least change in trends around the time of outbreaks or when there is an important 'tweet' etc.?
Implementation: I think this would be invaluable if scaled up to an automated algorithm, like a real time analysis that can extend to prediction for future etc.? I do not know the technical know-how but there are good models that predict the outbreaks and maybe they can be associated with the social media outcomes. 
Impact: This has great potential impact for the future, as this issue is nowhere near being gone. Hesitancy and general health behavior is highly related to culture and norms of that population. Should you decide to extend the analysis to other global communities, a suggestion would be to definitely implement social science protocols to understand why and how of people's behavior. 

This work is definitely needed and you are doing a great thing!!!",252,Aral,Sürmeli,2019-12-12T11:54:23.465Z
304,"Hey! This is a great project btw!

So I have couple suggestions that might be useful. I realized working with DHS of countries, they do not use the same statistical plan. For example: For Turkey, you can not find 'timely vaccination' they are aggregated, that might cause showing the vaccination coverage is higher than it acctually is. And they use that data to provide to WHO. So this is a small example, that might confound things. One should always be careful with the politics involved when aggregating country data. I know it is very very detailed thing, that might be overseen, just wanted to let you know. 

It is also important to realize that different countries use different vaccines. That actually vary a lot in efficacy and effectiveness. A future plan could be controlling the coverage with actual results of illness' or u5m. Again this is not vital for your project at the moment, but would be very useful in translating to health data!

Your project seems very impressive. 

We see in the 'How to contribute' section that this project is finished already. I think the project we are currently working on could be one of the 'users' of your platform / system.

The Cas13-based method developed by Sherlock is super easy. I think they are frantically scaling it up for distribution. See attached protocol.

Covid-19 has an RNA genome so any DNA-based test starts with reverse transcriptase. And any lab using surrogate RNA to develop and evaluate the test would have to be able to work RNAse-free.

417,"It looks like the virus has evolved into two different strains: an older, slower spreading strain (S) and a faster spreading, newer strain (L):

“Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (∼70%) is more prevalent than the S type (∼30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure.“

And we could use the fairly  classic protocol similar to this: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044
""Throat swab samples were collectedand placed into a collection tube with 150 μL of virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extracted within 2 hours using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Zhongzhi, Wuhan, China). In brief, 40 μL of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifugated at 1000 rpm/min for 5 minutes. The suspension was used for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 2019-nCoV RNA. Two target genes, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time RT-PCR assay. Target 1 (ORF1ab): forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA; reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA; and the probe 5′-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3′. Target 2 (N): forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT; reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG; and the probe 5′-FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3′. The real-time RT-PCR assay was performed using a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd). Reaction mixture contains 12 μL of reaction buffer, 4 μL of enzyme solution, 4 μL of Probe primers solution, 3 μL of diethyl pyrocarbonate–treated water, and 2 μL of RNA template. RT-PCR assay was performed under the following conditions: incubation at 50 °C for 15 minutes and 95 °C for 5 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55 °C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test.""

584,"!PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS!

Submit proposals using this form: https://forms.gle/MSxhfRatVCGdbsFK9
Deadline: 3 AM GMT, Tuesday, March 17 (8 PM PST, Monday, March 16)
Note that proposals should be in the ""4 page"" format described previously. They should also be in a Google Doc format. Please enter the link to the Google Doc as you complete the form.

Background:

With the support of many of you, we have found large engineering, regulatory and financial resources. We intend to assemble and focus these resources behind a few high quality projects to counter COVID-19. This is the fastest way to make a difference.
We will judge these proposals by their feasibility, speed, effectiveness, and their inability to be easily replaced by other efforts. 
We desire intensely for the entire process to be open and transparent. We will post the proposals, and tell you as much about the selection process as we can. We will also try to use public feedback from members. 

However, direct voting is unworkable. We have found a number of medical and industry experts to review the proposals—but we want as much opinion as possible, please contact us if you are an expert.

Immediate information we can give about the process:
-Proposals collected by the deadline indicated within 24 hours or less of the deadline, proposals will be made available to the public. 
-We will begin to review the proposals.
-96 hours after the deadline (48 hours more than initially announced), we will complete selection. Early decisions are possible.

Yes, we are open to other rounds of proposals — we created this early round because of the urgency to find proposals and teams that we can support with our resources.
For direct questions about the submission process, please contact @Chris LB Graham, administrator. 

We will post as much information as we can. Besides what is posted, there is limited information we can provide on the process. No one has done anything like this before—our focus is on results.

- Sur le groupe Français d’entraide 3D ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/1120744844933688/?ref=share ) ils commencent à trier les propositions, mais dans tous les cas, y compris dans le Discord de Mr bidouille,  ce qui semble manquer le plus c’est les besoins/demandes précises des  Hôpitaux avec cahier des charges. Et ensuite un moyen de créer le lien permanent entre soignants et makers pour co-concevoir de façon optimisée.

Donc je pense qu’un des trucs les plus urgents est de créer un canal de communication avec les urgentistes et les soignants sur le front/ via des tiers pourquoi pas (personnel administratifs des hôpitaux, enseignants assurant la garde de leurs enfants). Quelqu’un a une idée de lien d'interaction localement, de plateforme privilégiée pour lancer un appel ? Twitter avec un ashtag custom ? Une plateforme professionnelle ? Au quotidien dans l’hôpital, sur quel app les personnels sont le plus souvent? Est-ce que ça vaut la peine de créer un canal spécial ou un forum dédié?

L’utilité majeure serait pour l’instant c’est de pourvoir remonter les infos du terrain, les évaluer, trier et dispatcher pour les valoriser et valider rapidement des solutions. 

- La documentation est en ce sens fondamentale.  Une documentation structurée des initiatives en français pour les non anglophones. .Mais le framapad n’est pas adapté.  C’est trop lent et pas assez robuste. Une idée pour le substituer autre que googleDocs?

Je suis technicien de laboratoire de formation pratiqué 18 ans en hopital et depuis 18 ans technicien de maintenance Biomedical.

Il me semble qu'il manque ici un cahier des charges, je vous propose quelques pistes issues de mes réflexions

A- On est d'accord pour dire que ce qui serait éventuellement proposé est seulement une alternative a ça ou rien il n'est pas envisageable de se substituer a un équipement normé si il est disponible.

B les masques
1- corps, il doit etre imprimable rapidement, on oublie les formes évoluées avec support et 3 h de print. Cecqui parait le plus facile cest la forme a plat de max 1mm a thermoformer sur un moule (eau bouillante). En pla ou petg. Ca permet d'imprimer beaucoup et rapidement. Imperatis, une poche ou autre contenant le filtre jeté a chaque contacts.

2- le filtre
a- theoriquement le filtre doit piuvoir retenir les virus pratiquement ce n'est pas faisable avec des miyens amateurs permettant de laisser passer l'air et il faut absolument que l'air passe par les filtres MAIS le virud, globalement, ne voyage pas seul, il est lié aux gouttelettes de salive et postillons, aux cellules etc. Dans un contexte de ca ou rien, on peut capturer ces particules.
b- matériaux
- le plus efficace est le feutre mais il faur en trouver facilement
- perso, je dirais un sandwich fait de coton cardé au mieux, hydrophile au pire entre deus sopalin. La oremiere et derniere couche ayant l'avantage de capturer les oarticules humides en entree er sortie et surtout xq se trouve facilement.

B- les respi. Ne revez pas on improvise pas un venrilateur de réa. Je veux bien vous donner les caractéristiques minimales mais le temps de ke mettre au piint5 ça ira plus vite de balonner manuellement les patients.

Voila voila qqes idées",2054,vivien,roussel,2020-03-17T17:41:31.391Z

624,"Bonjour,
Une réflexion m’est venue hier soir afin d’éviter les attroupements au niveau des supermarchés. Puisqu’aujourd’hui, on peut tous être livré chez soi ou au bureau, il serait bon d’appliquer la livraison à domicile en utilisant les Uber cars qui eux n’ont plus lieu d’être en ce moment. 
Dans un premier temps, que les directions s’assurent de la mise à jour de leur site et de la capacité à accueillir un grand nombre de commande. Une limitations sur certains produits pourrait être fait en fonction de l’adresse de livraison, ou du nom, ou de l’adresse IP. 
Ensuite prévoir avec Uber une collaboration direct pour ce genre de courses et une installation des chauffeurs sur les parkings des supermarchés.
Ensuite une communication pour alerter la fermeture des magasins aux clients.
Évidemment, la mise en œuvre serait moins simple et évidente. C’est une première réflexion.  ",2186,Damien,Lancon,2020-03-18T06:42:01.064Z

627,"Bonjour à tous, depuis hier soir nous sommes plusieurs à avoir compris qu’il fallait peut-être arrêter de chercher à substituer par impression 3d des éléments de machines médicales ultra spécialisées dans des procédures délicates dans un environnement contagieux sur des patients fragilisés. 
Mais nous continuons de penser aussi que la communauté maker open source peut aider sur d’autres besoins des soignants, tant ceux qui sont dans les hôpitaux que ceux qui sont dehors (libéraux, ehpad, sos médecins, brancardier, ambulanciers,...).
Voir le post de Jessica :
https://www.facebook.com/groups/670932227050506/permalink/675752273235168/
En ce sens le plus urgent reste d’enquêter sur les besoins des personnels suscités et de créer des cahiers des charges pour chaque item à fabriquer. Essentiellement du matériel de protection dont la pénurie se fait déjà sentir.

Jessica a listé des exemples dans le contexte US, mais il faut garder en tête que les pénuries seront différentes en fonction des régions et même des hôpitaux. Notre force est de pouvoir réagir localement et sur mesure sur des besoins spécifiques tout en documentant pour permettre aux autres d'itérer et de ne pas repartir de zéro. En gros gagner du temps par la documentation et la coordination, mais être proche du besoin local. C'est la définition même des fablabs (on peut d'ailleurs  mobiliser aussi les découpeuses laser ou cnc ou brodeuse numérique: est-ce que réouvrir un fablab pour réaliser une petite série pour les soignants n'est pas une cause suffisante de dérogation officielle?)

Comme le résume si bien Stéphane: chacun concentré sur le local en terme de besoin, à définir, identifier, faire, agir . Le réseau pour trouver la solution à  son problème local en terme de ressource dev si besoin, fichiers, design à récupérer.
 
Nous sommes en train de réorganiser les pads dans le sens de la meilleure documentation possible pour cordonner les efforts de tous les groupes Facebook/discord et autres, et permettre de documenter les projets de fabrication items par items entre groupes de volontaires et anticiper la montée en charge des données/connections (avec des sous-pads à partager sur les réseaux)

Et surtout il faut mettre en place des systèmes de contacts et de dialogues entre les soignants et les makers, alors que les premiers sont noyés et n’ont pas le temps d’aller sur internet. Plusieurs hypothèses: - utiliser les administrateurs des hôpitaux qui sauront comment et quand trouver des moments d’échanges
- monter un espace virtuel d’échange dédié qui fonctionne avec un dictaphone. 
- d’ailleurs des médecins urgentistes aux US ont évoqué le besoin de développer une app qui leur permettrait d’échanger entre eux anonymement autour du coronavirus mais en vérifiant au préalable leurs « credentials » et spécialités. En open source pour que chaque pays puisse se l’approprier dans sa langue.  
Si vous connaissez des développeurs du libre c’est le moment de leur glisser l’idée. Partager dans les réseaux.  On pourrait avoir un canal séparé dans cette app pour qu’ils exprime leurs besoins aux communautés Maker localement.
 - une autre idée de premier contact: via les instits de permanence pour garder le personnel soignant
- via les famille des malades pour leur donner une chance d’agir aussi de leur côté face au manques constatés.

642,"I have developed a design for a ventilator that is pneumatically driven, which I can make available to you. The idea is to develop a 3D printable design that could be mass produced anywhere with access to a 3D printer and some basic supplies to complete construction. The device would be cheap enough compared to conventional resources as to be considered disposable. I need some assistance with the technical aspects of the design which are beyond my capabilities with a goal of releasing an open source file to be used anywhere with anticipated demand.

In keeping with the spirit of this project, I have attached a link to a PDF of my design. My goal is not to make money off this project, I want to save lives.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/6jjf7wf2vx01wzd/vent%20design.pdf.pdf?dl=0

A ventilator design like this takes a continuous flow of gas (measured in L/min) and divides it into an inspiratory and expiratory phase for the patient. The percentage of oxygen the patient receives is determined by the mixture of medical air (21% O2) and 100% oxygen which we have mounted on the walls of our treatment rooms. The minute ventilation for the patient (the total volume of gas inhaled per minute by the patient) is determined by the combined flow rate of medical air and oxygen. The tidal volume is the amount of gas inhaled by the patient with each breath and there needs to be a controller built into this design to control this variable. Once the bellows has filled to supply this tidal volume, the controller will need to change the setting of the switches to deliver the gas and allow for expiration. When the bellows empties, the expiratory switch needs to flip to allow for the patient to exhale. The respiratory rate is a function of the tidal volume and the minute ventilation. The bellows is weighted; the weight on the bellows will determine the I:E ratio (the ratio of time allowed for inspiration relative to expiration) because a heavier weight will allow the inspiratory phase to be completed more rapidly in compared with the passive expiratory phase. PEEP (or positive end expiratory pressure) is the resistance to exhalation provided by a flow restrictor on the “exhaust port” of the circuit and is a separate device which we have on hand. I do not have the technical expertise to design the switches or to CAD draft this design, which is why I have reached out for assistance.

The PEEP valve is standard and can be attached externally. The check valve is a one way valve like this (https://www.penncare.net/product/chest-drain-valve-bd-heimlich/​). The switch controller would need to be designed by an engineer. The one adjustable setting would be the tidal volume which triggers the system to flip modes. All 5 switches would need to flip when the bellows fills to the tidal volume, the expiration switch would need to flip when the bellows empties.
The goal would be to print enough of the device that someone like me could assemble it from the printed components and other readily available supplies.",2553,Douglas,Romney,2020-03-18T13:45:24.782Z

Dataset Description
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 29,000 scholarly articles, including over 13,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.

Call to Action
We are issuing a call to action to the world's artificial intelligence experts to develop text and data mining tools that can help the medical community develop answers to high priority scientific questions. The CORD-19 dataset represents the most extensive machine-readable coronavirus literature collection available for data mining to date. This allows the worldwide AI research community the opportunity to apply text and data mining approaches to find answers to questions within, and connect insights across, this content in support of the ongoing COVID-19 response efforts worldwide. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid increase in coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical community to keep up.

A list of our initial key questions can be found under the Tasks section of this dataset. These key scientific questions are drawn from the NASEM’s SCIED (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats) research topics and the World Health Organization’s R&amp;D Blueprint for COVID-19.

Many of these questions are suitable for text mining, and we encourage researchers to develop text mining tools to provide insights on these questions.

Prizes
Kaggle is sponsoring a $1,000 per task award to the winner whose submission is identified as best meeting the evaluation criteria. The winner may elect to receive this award as a charitable donation to COVID-19 relief/research efforts or as a monetary payment. More details on the prizes and timeline can be found on the discussion post.

Accessing the Dataset
We have made this dataset available on Kaggle, and are periodically updating it from its source. To learn more and access the latest copy of the dataset, you can also go here: https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research.

The licenses for each dataset can be found in the all _ sources _ metadata csv file.

674,"Hello Everyone! Thanks so much for joining us for our third all-community call! We've grown quite a bit and it's great to see some new faces each week!

If you didn't get a chance to be on the call, here are the notes from it (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gs5MyQlXHMTY3FhtvN3__pNhfhjrCtneueV4whvlZck/edit) and the recording (https://youtu.be/Y55yX65pSUE). There are some important logistics so I'd recommend skimming through the agenda if you have the chance.

Wanted to quickly summarize a few of the important points:

1. Our Program Page is now live (this page)! If you're working on a project, it'd be amazing if you could create a channel dedicated to it (with the #proj-xx naming convention) and consider listing it on JOGL under the program for more visibility amongst the community. To create a channel, just select the + icon next to ""Channels"". To see all the channels, just click the word Channels.

2. Regardless of if you've got a project on JOGL, our Slack, workspace or in your own lab/institution please fill out this form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEYxDM-eTdpWXSCRevC_iStJwIrTu5oByQkkFdym8BcgZksA/viewform) to quickly summarize your project. We'd like to make it easily visible to the community at large the amazing work groups part of this initiative are doing.

3. If you haven't gotten the chance to, please read over the Onboarding Doc (bit.ly/opencovid19-onboarding). It's still under construction but it has important directions on Drive access and our Team Survey.

4. If you need access to literature or are looking for articles on specific topics, join the #prgm-paperaccess channel.

5. Here's a list of calls happening this week, hope we'll see a few of you on them! The agendas will be posted (or already posted) in the respective channels below.

3/19 6PM CET (Paris time) - Communications Call (#prgm-communications-team)
3/20 4PM CET - Governance Call (#prgm-governance-team)

686,"Anyone with access to 3D printers...
You can literally print masks following this procedure: 
http://copper3d.com/hackthepandemic/stl/STL.zip

It needs about 50 grams of filament (not PLA, better use TPU or TPE) for printing (41 grams for the mask, 3 grams for the middle part and 6 grams for the cap), which costs around 4 euros (depends on the country actually, if you order one from the big chinese eshops maybe it's cheaper per unit, but it takes time to deliver)
When it is printed (it needs about 2 hours), you can use a round filter, like a piece of surgical mask, with 3,7 cm diameter.
A typical surgical mask is about 17,5 x 9,5 cm so you can get around 8 pieces (2 x 4), which are placed one by one in the mask.
- Be careful, so the filter is the right size, and no air goes around.
- After every use, throw away the used filter and wash the mask with disinfectant, wipe clean, in order to be safe for latter use.
- If your area is low in mask supply, you can use make up pads, which normally are not in high demand.

I hope this helps! May the force be with you ! (and sorry for my English)",361,Alejandra,Rodriguez Llerena,2020-03-19T13:55:39.143Z

I personally started to re-implement the data fetching for both the Oura Ring and Fitbit to have those sources directly in the Quantified Flu app. The work took me most of the day and it's basically reproducing the work of the existing Open Humans data importer tools, but we thought it's necessary to have them right in the Quantified Flu app to minimize the amount of work we make new users jump through at sign-up. By having the Fitbit/Oura sign-ins right in QF we don't have to re-route the hopefully large number of newcomers! The code updates for that one are at https://github.com/madprime/quantified-flu/pull/9

Assessing Health Systems Resilience has never felt more concrete and necessary than today! Join us in this collaborative effort! 

Within ClimHB, we study both population health in mobility settings and health systems resilience, in a context of climate change. The interaction between these two dimensions can be studied through a Healthcare Access perspective. As a guidance in our actual empirical work, we have developed a Conceptual Framework adapted from Levesque et al. Framework on Healthcare Access. This is a modest proposal that we will test in the course of our project. However, in this perspective of open and collaborative science, we wish to share our reflections with as many people as possible.

There are many ways you can contribute to our work! For instance:
- evaluating our Conceptual Framework dimensions, and determining which dimensions, interactions and links could be missing;
- supporting the Conceptual Framework graphic design to make it more intelligible and make its interactive features visible.

We are looking forward to enlighting collaborations!

Our peer review has resulted in the Offset ventilator (short term), O2 concentrator (slightly longer term) and Hardware: PPE (short term) being chosen as our official hardware projects. In addition the tube connectors project scored very highly in our review. The best software project was the database for local manufacturers able to produce hardware due to its simplicity and high score in reviews.
Please have a read of this presentation for info why, and what our review process was, the following slides were shared with the administration team and made their final decision.
What will happen next?
As highlighted projects, these projects will be given special treatment of focussed QA and facilitation by our volunteers, they may get funding, and will be advertised in our media as important. This is the first round of review for specifically high impact, low time investment projects, and we encourage you to continue working to facilitate yourselves and produce the incredible projects and outcomes you are doing in any project. Reach out to our team for any resources you need and advise. There will be another wave some time next week, with more technical emphasis and increased scope.
We are proud of our community and want to help you help yourselves and your local areas. Congratulations to @Stu-co, @Nick Moser @Douglas Keith @Kenneth Yeung @Brian , @RuurdMoelker we will be contacting you shortly.

The deadline for the Grant application is Friday 1am 27th March GMT, at which point the form will close and an open review will begin.

Call for Proposals for sampling swabs.

Doctors have called on us to source sampling swabs, as there is a shortage. If you would like to submit a project proposal for sampling swabs, please use this template https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pmVFvD_LFAcYMSE_d3L_L1cSFL3SYcXdOx5G1gop98A/edit?usp=sharing and submit this template to this form to https://forms.gle/TBHqx6DDzsi8HErw8.

Review process

We will be reviewing the above documents through crowd sourced peer review again in a similar way to wave one. To increase the effectiveness of this, a more thorough peer review form has been made, however we will need more reviewers! We will announce when reviewing begins and conduct an open crowd sourced review. If you would like to take part as an expert reviewer in addition, please contact @Chris LB Graham.

Emergency mask for hospital ventilators

In recent days we have been contacted by a former head physician of the Gardone Valtrompia Hospital, Dr. Renato Favero, who’ve got in touch with Isinnova through a doctor from the Chiari Hospital, the health facility for which we were manufacturing the emergency valves with 3D printing process. Doctor Favero shared with us an idea to fix the possible shortage of hospital C-PAP masks for sub-intensive therapy, which is emerging as a concrete problem linked to the spread of Covid-19: it’s the construction of an emergency ventilator mask, realized by adjusting a snorkeling mask already available on the market.
We analyzed the proposal together with the inventor. We contacted in little time Decathlon, as ideator, productor and supplier of the snorkeling Easybreath mask. The company was immediately willing to cooperate by providing the CAD drawing of the mask we had identified. The product was dismantled, studied, and the changes to be made were evaluated. A new component was then designed to guarantee the connection to the ventilator. We called the link Charlotte valve, and we quickly printed it using 3D printing.
The prototype as a whole has been tested on one of our colleagues directly inside the Chiari Hospital, connected to the ventilator body, and has proven to be correctly working. The hospital itself was enthusiastic about the idea and decided to test the device on a patient in need. The testing was successful. We’are reiterating that the idea is designed for healthcare facilities and wants to help in realization of an emergency mask in the case of a full-blown difficult situation, where is not possible to in find official healthcare supplies. Neither the mask nor the link are certified and their use is subject to a situation of mandatory need.
Usage by the patient is subjected to the acceptance of use of an uncertified biomedical device, by providing a signed declaration.
Whereas the effectiveness of the project, we decided to urgently patent the link valve (Charlotte Valve), to prevent any speculation on the price of the component. We clarify that the patent will remain free to use, because it is in our intention that all hospitals in need could use it if necessary.
We decided to freely share the file for the realization of the link in 3d printing. Unlike the respirator valve, the link is easy to make, so it is possible for all makers to try to print it correctly.
Healthcare facilities in difficulty will be able to purchase the Decathlon mask (here the link), and get in contact with 3d printers who could make the piece and provide it.

We clarify that our initiative is totally non-profit, we will not obtain any royalties on the idea of ​​the link, nor on the sales of Decathlon masks.
Below you will find:

We can provide further support and further details to healthcare facilities and makers who want to make the connection, if necessary.

Having established that the UK government will be rolling out mass testing and not just 3.5 million tests as originally noted, the urgency of this project is no longer there. In light of this I will be approaching each person currently or planning to be involved to archive our work for the future and reconsider what our collective next steps are.
Suggestions:
(1)	Database development: Any work done or agreed so far to be documented on an open-source platform such as Github so it can be revisited in the future at the appropriate moment. This includes the fuller steps of mobilising the non-governmental medical infrastructure in the UK and the first digital step in development with a map of independent hospitals.
(2)	Open to conversation with related projects in LA and Hawaii: Momentum for a zoom conversation has not been reached at this point. Considering the change in circumstances the plan for zoom call is paused until reorganised by members of related projects.
(3)	1-2-1 conversations have been held with different potential members of a starting base for this project. A zoom call is planned next week. . Considering the change in circumstances the plan for zoom call is paused for those still in the process of being invited.
(4)	The core people: This accelerator https://thecoronavirushackathon.com/ will help define moving forward. If you are interested in participating together as a team get in contact

Outputs:
•	Project so far. Ideally in the form of Github accompanied with text document.
•	Momentum of base team of social scientists engaging in opencovid19
•	I will personally maintain some contributions to the opencovid19 project such as the Project Review programme.

756,"Starting a project : outsider's approach of coronavirus treatment scheme.

Most therapy research is devoted to the well known aspects of coronavirus vs.host cell interaction. Potentializers of antivirals are needed as none in their 20 years history has been strikingly effective. While emergency has put an emphasis upon already approved drugs as priority candidates for covid19, we think and daily updates confirm until now, that structure-activity AI driven screening models have failed to identify sound but yet unknown modes of action. As China's first approach upon testing any candidate supplied by a potential provider proved very disappointing, there is a good chance we could succeed although there is no guarantee, but why not?
 

We wish to gather a task force, open minded, with specialists of epigenetic, PD at intracellular level of membrane efflux (or penetration), autophagy, macrophages and dendritic cell activation, membrane stability, and H+ or K+ exchanges, researchers focussing on LE/E  roles whatever anti-infectious, anti-cancerous background, specialists of NFkappaB system. 
PK/PD understanding would definitely be a plus, although our small group is ok on that area!
Thousands of protease inhibitors,  of ATPase dep H+ or K+ modulators are not available to an outsider point of view as big pharmas are focussed on this promising approach.It is the same with statins that never ever have found a rationale for use while making blockbusters ...

Nevertheless our idea ( membrane fluxes are key to viral multiplication and to escape of cytokine control, which is a general consensus) is leading to the review of potential key role of drugs already approved in the potentialization of hypothetic therapies. 

We have identified at least two pairs of candidates, that besides fitting those consensual and up to date analysis through different pathways, in relation to pore forming conditions, are very likely compatible with most if not all present hypothesis and even theories elaborated specifically after coronavirus sars-cov2 contact.
We believe that if emergency context does not allow for elucidation of complete work upon dimer selection of NFKB involved in the various processes mentioned above, there is a very good chance that our approach would equal or outperform all noise made around the old CHQ, whose toxicity is incompatible with its use in ICU patients.

It is essential to our point of view that participants are well instructed, trained, harsh criticisers -hopefully positively oriented but we accept and welcome those of the community who are keen to say ; ""hey Sir you're wrong"", whatever slang they'd use , PROVIDING they explain why, and suggest another option whatever this option would be within the project scope (sentences such as "" I have used chloroquine when I was 12 and happened to be travelling to Africa"" are prohibited as it clearly indicates that you have not checked the difference between 100 and 600 mg dosing, neither tox models of renal impairment in mice, nor the outcome of chinese study on 30 patients ...)
We are working on the rationale of an outsider approach that is scientifically sound and believe that from existing toolbox no single miracle product will help but potentialized chemotherapeutics will, providing we are flexible in therapeutic protocols so they are constantly adapted to patient individual history and stage of the disease as it is notorious that antiviral treatment should start early enough but not as preventatives to avoid resistance induction (of course depending upon the mode of action) and later stages are under the control of cytokines storm that should be avoided.
Looking fwd to reading from you soon.
Be prepared , in the case of success that great mouthes will spoil you of your contribution especially that druggable targets will be assessed with patent soon to expire drugs and thus the manufacturer and the people who have missed the train could become very aggressive thereafter our significant advances.
We are expecting support from specialists of:
epigenesis onset and control,
drug penetration
silica models
humanised mice models specialists ( our friends at Pasteur and vicinity are overwhelmed at present)
clinical pharmacologists

Au Burkina Faso le nombre de cas ne fait qu'augmenter, cependant l'ensemble des agents de santé et du personnel soignant abattent un travail exceptionnel pour enrayer la propagation du Coronavirus. Le personnel soignant manque de tout (manque de masques de protection, insuffisance de gel hydro-alcoolique, absence d'appareils respiratoire pour les malades atteints du Covid-19). Il ya certains agents de santé qui mènent le combat à mains nues à leur risque et péril sachant très bien qu'ils sont fortement exposés au Covid-19. Je voudrais donc lancer un appel pour la production et la livraison d'un certains nombre d'équipements de protection au profit du personnel soignant, cet appel sonne comme un cri de désespoir pour un système sanitaire qui a largement atteint ses limites et qui flirte dangereusement avec la zone de non retour. Nos agents de santé ont notamment besoin en urgence de visières de protection pour mener la riposte contre le Coronavirus. Toute aide permettant l'acquisition de ces matériels de protection sera la bienvenue. Si jamais la ligne de défense constituée par le personnel de santé venait à céder, le Burkina Faso va basculer dans le chaos. Merci d'avance pour votre aide",3099,Amos,Traore,2020-03-30T01:49:18.884Z

791,"Community Initiatives to Implement Testing for Covid-19

All over the world, governments are focussing their efforts on “flattening the curve” - spreading out the number of Covid-19 fatalities over a longer period so a healthcare system is not overwhelmed. But how do we also shorten the curve – and avoid a prolonged period of enforced isolation and social turmoil? Our aim is to design a process to identify local resources which can implement new open-source designs for mass testing. This form of mass testing can end the threat of the virus and the harm caused by a prolonged lockdown.

Using the UK as a case study, we have identified promising designs for a variety of testing methods and we intend to map both the resources and facilities in the UK capable of manufacturing and implementing these methods. The project then aims to connect the capable organisations into an initiative to implement testing on a far larger scale than what has been proposed so far by government. This project is part of the JOGL Opencovid19 Initiative and a research partner of KISS (Kent Interdisciplinary Centre for Spatial Studies).

We invite people to join our 2nd community call to contribute to the project.

We would like to provide live update data to reach both targets, without sacrifying data privacy. We are an international team and would like a model which would be rolled out anywhere, not only in big cities but also in places where people have less means and less access to medical infrastructures.
We need dev, data scientist for calculation to make heat maps, big data specialist, medical workers to validate the information given for self assessment, legal for privacy of data. We really would like to make it real now as the easiest canvas which would be used anywhere, just being adapted.

If you create visualization code, we'd love to share with others – we have a system for sharing notebooks for Python &amp; R. And JS visualizations could be added to the site itself! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 📊📊📊📊


There's two basic types of data:

1. data around retrospective events, and 
2. data around ongoing symptom reports. 

We would especially love visualizations for ongoing symptom reports. 💖

Both of these are available in JSON and CSV formats. We went with what we thought made sense – so, feedback on the formats is very welcome. 

Instructions on getting the data are below:

## Lists of all available data
JSON is available to provide the paths for all public data,
- retrospective events: https://quantifiedflu.org/retrospective/public.json 
- symptom reports https://quantifiedflu.org/report/public.json

The same public data is visible (human readable) at https://quantifiedflu.org/retrospective/public &amp; https://quantifiedflu.org/report/public when you click through, you can add "".json"" or "".csv"" to a URL to get associated data.

### Example of data from retrospective event 

These are provided according to event ID, e.g. for ""1"": https://quantifiedflu.org/retrospective/event/1.json and https://quantifiedflu.org/retrospective/event/1.csv

### Example of data from ongoing symptom reports 
These are provided according to an individuals random identifier, e.g. for ""20383123"": https://quantifiedflu.org/report/list/member/20383123.json and https://quantifiedflu.org/report/list/member/20383123.csv",108,Bastian,Greshake Tzovaras,2020-04-29T14:31:11.044Z

1023,"Hi there,

I hope you are keeping well. I am leading a team for the NASA COVID-19 SpaceApps Challenge (https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/) and am looking for team members. The aim of my team is to understand the environmental impacts of COVID-19 in Low- and Middle- income countries, focusing on deforestation / mining as a result of economic disruption (https://www.conservation.org/press-releases/2020/04/21/conservation-international-reports-increase-in-poaching-and-tropical-deforestation-due-to-covid-19-restrictions). We are looking for friendly team mates with skills in one or more of the following: understanding of vulnerable communities in low- and middle- income countries, web-design, video editing, scientific computing satellite imagery analysis, or team management. You are warmly welcome you to join, no matter where you are.

Requirements

You need to be available for one or two meetings half hour meetings during this week (beginning Monday 25 th May) and for the duration of the hackathon weekend from 10:00 BST 29th - 31st May (we'll finish before midnight I am sure!). We all have time comittments, so don't worry if you are juggling other things (an online degree, kids, washing clothes, etc), we will work around our comittments. 

There are limits on the sizes of teams that can enter for the NASA challenge, so we will decide on the final team based on the best combination of experience to help understand the problem. However, the plan is that the work will continue beyond the challenge, so don't hesitate to join, and send me a message.

Get in touch

If you are interested, please message or email me to let me know with a short paragraph to say who you are, why you want to get involved and up to three skills you want to strengthen in the hackathon.

About me

I am an environmental consultant based in London. My claim to fame is that I wrote a program executed on the International Space Station, using a Raspberry Pi (for another space competition) :-) I am looking to take part in NASA's hackathon to strengthen my understanding of issues in low- and middle-income countries, improve my team collaboration skills, and to write code!

How much is the BOM? What should be the pressure (max torque) achievable? 

How does the mechanical design compare to this ""old"" design/project documented on the appropedia: https://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_syringe_pump (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107216)?

Dear everyone, 👋😷
I’m very happy to announce the results for our 3rd round of JOGL micro-grant reviews! 🤩🔥

- First of all, thank you to all the reviewers! We have received 62 reviews for 11 project applications! This review process couldn’t have happened without you 🙏
 
- JOGL will fund this time 5 extremely promising projects providing a total amount of 18 000 euros for this third round! Congrats to the winning projects! 👏👏👏

- 3 projects are creating apps to respectively track the virus, protect those against domestic abuse during the outbreak, and do fact checking! 💻🛡

- 2 projects are using biotech to develop diagnostic tests. The first one is the continuation of an already awarded project in round 1 and the second one is creating a kit of opensource enzymes to use for COVID testing! 🦠🔬⚗️🧬

We will contact the winners directly in order to process the payments as fast as possible! 
This is again a great achievement for this community, the OpenCovid19 Initiative and for JOGL 🙌

We want to make this peer-reviewing process as useful as possible for the projects and the community, <a href=""/user/101""><span>@</span>Christopher LB Graham</a> and <a href=""/user/4099""><span>@</span>Elliot Lawton</a> will contact you to get your feedbacks on it.

Dear community members, 

This new event is one of the many ways that JOGL supports open research and innovation. During a one-hour live call, we choose a project on JOGL and bring it into the spotlight.

 We will talk with <a href=""/user/108""><span>@</span>Bastian Greshake Tzovaras</a>, <a href=""/user/335""><span>@</span>Mad Ball</a>,  and Gary Wolf about the <a href=""/project/135""><span>#</span>Quantified Flu</a> project. Can physiological parameters tracked by our wearables predict when we’re getting sick? By launching a collaborative citizen science project around this, the 'Quantified Flu' team hopes to harness the collective intelligence of all participants to quickly get a better understanding of our data!

The team is looking for data analysts, students, or experts. This is a great opportunity to create new collaborations! Go check their needs on their project page! https://app.jogl.io/project/135#needs

1062,"hi!
we've been doing more 'sequence gazing' in terms of multiplex hopes while awaiting the latest order of primers.
even though in silico predictions might be a bit discouraging, as in the attached pdf, with complex interactions between sequences possible, you always have to see how the target sets work empirically...  
patience while the situation again seems to worsen in regards to corona, internationally, at least, is not easy..

to give you a qualitative impression of what our amplification data can look like - so lovely - signals for all the tubes of the 8th round (including saliva tests) are shown. 
an end point image of the raw data obtained to make such curves is also included (in black&amp;white - so good together!)

looking forward to many more results soon, from Guy in Paris too.

1070,"As we all are gradually emerging out of our homes, this is an attempt at summarizing literature that used mass spectrometry for CoVid-19 study. One of the papers that recently grabbed my attention popped up in my social media feed. 
The published work could detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins from oral gargle solutions of CoViD-19 positive patients (positively identified with RT-PCR). The gargle solutions (750 µL) were collected and protein precipitation carried out with acetone (1 mL) treatment (overnight at -20°C). The samples were then centrifuged, supernatant discarded and the protein precipitate was first solubilized in digestion buffer. Glycosylations were removed from the protein precipitate with PNGase enzyme. The protein precipitate was subsequently digested with trypsin for liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Chromatography separations was performed on nano-HPLC system (C18 column) coupled with Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Further details of the experiment can be found in the link below.
The group was able to identify nucleocapsid proteins from the CoVid-19 positive samples. Although this work was carried out on only three samples, the salient features of the work stand out: (i) Diluted gargle solutions as samples: mass spectrometry is a sensitive technique and identifying SARS-CoV-2 proteins from non-invasive samples as gargle solutions provide immense scope for developing diagnostics. (ii) Scope of translating workflow: as methods are gradually developed for identification of proteins, the method has scope for translation to high-throughput platforms such as triple quadrupole mass spectrometers. I hope this method finds more use in future.

1081,"Weekly Digest 2

 Last week we looked at how mass spectrometry can be used for SARS-COV-2 identification from gargle solutions. This week we delve into host response with mass spectrometry for CoVid-19 infection. The work has potential for biomarker discovery and for developing targeted assays in future. 

The proteomics study was carried out in UK and the patient samples were procured from Germany. Serum samples from CoVid positive patients with different severity (WHO 3-7) were compared with general baseline population from Scotland (age matched). One of the key aspects of the study is partial automation of the sample preparation with liquid handling systems including protein digestion and desalting. It is significant since it reduces the exposure of the technician to the samples and most importantly increases throughout of the overall sample preparation process. In addition, the developed LC method increases throughput while using a shorter gradient flow. The proteomics MS method used here is data independent acquisition (DIA) which involves subjecting all the peptides to MS/MS. The advantage of using such a workflow lies in getting a broader protein coverage including less abundant proteins in a single analytical run.

The study identified proteins involved in inflammation, complement activation and blood coagulation as some of the markers that change markedly in WHO 3-7 grades. Namely, serum amyloid A protein (SAA) and apolipoproteins show a marked increase and decrease respectively as the severity increases. This is a promising start for future proteomics and biomarker discovery studies. Please find the link for the paper below:

We aim to create a model of how tweets about self-reported COVID19 symptoms can help predict upcoming pandemic waves, and more generally the rise and fall of the disease. To that end, we crawled public tweets from the Paris region filtered by symptoms keywords, and plotted them in time. However, this filtering is very crude, e.g people don’t only tweet about symptoms when they are currently falling sick, but also about that one time a year ago when they fell sick, or when talking about the general news.

👉👉👉 To filter out such false-positives we need your help! 👈👈👈
Which of these tweets are describing an acute symptom and which ones don’t? Your contribution will make a direct impact!

1275,"When #openscience fights #COVID19🔥

I don't know where to start, so much has happened since I last posted here. I wanted to share with you some incredible news coming from the JOGL community participating in The OpenCovid19 Initiative we launched more than 7 months ago.

For context, OpenCOVID19 is a community-led program designed to support open science projects and the creation of open source tools that can fight the COVID19 pandemic. Back in February, I initiated OpenCOVID19 with a call to my community to create an open source and low cost diagnostic test for COVID19 while our public institutions were failing at producing a tactical response to the upcoming pandemic. It started with 10 motivated individuals. So far, we have now more than 4000 individuals who have joined JOGL and more than 100 projects are in active development in areas such as prevention, education, diagnostic, treatment and public heatlh 🤯😍🙏

We could celebrate all those projects, in fact I encourage you to do so by checking them on app.jogl.io or by following the JOGL - Just One Giant Lab news. But this time I'm going to focus on just 4 projects:
I cannot expressed how proud and excited I am to announce that 4 of the COVID19 diagnostic test projects, that the JOGL community has been working on in the last 6 months, have been accepted in the semi-final of the XPRIZE! 👏👏👏

For context, these diagnostic tests are open source (the only ones in the world so far!) and developed by JOGL community members coming from different countries, individuals that never met before. Projects collaborate with each other, in synergy, providing complementary approaches to the same problem.

Their tests rely on LAMP technology, a DNA amplification method that doesn't need a costly PCR machine, takes less than one hour to resolve, is super cheap, and so is super scalable! Our partners at AP-HP had some very encouraging results using one of them.

Folks, this is the proof that community-based science and innovation not only works but is efficient and scalable! Now, these four projects are competing in the XPrize with much larger and richer companies, startups and academic labs. We've been supporting them financially so far using our micro-grant system, more than 60 000 euros were distributed to more than 20 projects, thanks to our partners AXA Research Fund and Vinci Foundation.

👉 But we need more support. If you are in the capacity to help us make open science win this fight against COVID, please contact us to make a donation 🙏

This is so exciting for the future! ❤️",3,Thomas,Landrain,2020-10-08T15:13:13.348Z

1309,"Hi All!

The 4th round of open peer-reviewing and JOGL micro-grant application is finally OPEN!!!

This is going to be a smaller round than before (10k euros), put in place to support the community while waiting to find more funders for JOGL. We expect projects to not ask more than 1500 euros each, the smaller you ask, the higher the chance you have to be funded. We will prioritize projects that either (1) were already funded, got outstanding results and need additional support, or (2) unfunded projects that can do a lot with a small amount of funding.

If you don’t need a grant you can also win visibility and have your project peer reviewed!

If you are interested PLEASE follow all the steps mentioned in this document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Udagi-PSsiUT4pv1DVnxRbaYyyq754xCAG7IX1ASm5w/edit?usp=sharing

JOGL Micro-Grant and peer review Summary

The deadline for this Round is October 18th 9am UTC.
• Positively reviewed projects are more visible to the global community and can access the JOGL network of partners!
• JOGL micro-grants can amount to up to 1500 Euros (aim smaller if possible to increase your chances)
• Projects will have to use their JOGL project page to present their proposal so it will be transparent to everyone in this community 🔍 
One submission per project leader.
• Your project will then be reviewed by other applicants and reviewers in the community and the results shared 8 days after submissions close!
• Applications must be from open source projects
• Applicants must take part in the peer review process (in their own time during the 8 day waiting period) and will be emailed a link to review three other projects upon the closure of the round.

The application process is also open to the world, so don’t hesitate to share this to a project not yet part of the JOGL community 📣
If you have any questions please message me!

Good luck!",101,Chris LB,Graham,2020-10-12T07:19:14.471Z

Expression in BL21(DE3)pLys yielded 2.1mg/100ml of culture, with a purity of 85% (estimated by SDS gel). For Purification Alex' Brown's protocol was followed and a Ni-NTA of 1.5 ml was used.
Validation of the DNA LAMP test model (SARS-CoV-2 N-protein targeting primers taken from Zhang et al 2020 with N-protein plasmid provided by a befriended laboratory) showed positive endpoint detection, but not a good result with gel electrophoresis. Awaiting the test model from Rachel Aronoff of CoronaDetective to try it again, before starting realtime evalutation and specific activity measurements.

Expression with Ni-IDA columns (less expensive than Ni-NTA) showed high impurities, implicating these columns are not to be used without polishing with this protocol. However, there was a update on the purification protocol, with highly optimized buffers. Will test Ni-IDA columns again with this one and reevaluate.",4432,Kathrin,Hadasch,2020-10-18T19:37:43.835Z
1323,"Progess report on epiLAB - in silico domain:
Extensive research on DNA polymerases literature was done prior to setting up the infrastructure.
We managed to get a grand for the high performance computing cluster in Darmstadt, Germany and some sponsoring from AWS.
On the HPC-cluster we will screen for possible mutational sides with the Rosetta Commons framework. We set up the infrastructure already, and relaxed two suiting structures of Bst-LF. Interestingly, they showed a higher stability without complexed ions, which contradicts experimental data. This finding needs further assessment, before we use this structures for mutational sampling.
In parallel we set up a sequence database for mutational sampling &amp; the AWS infrastructure for Gromacs stability assessment MD simulation runs.",4432,Kathrin,Hadasch,2020-10-18T19:45:34.003Z

• Over 4300 registered students on the platform. 
• About 41% of the student population are female.
• 167 topics covered.
• Over 85% completion rate per topic, on average.
• Users from across Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone and The Gambia.
• Older students (above 19 years) are using the platform to prepare for private School Leaving Exams (GCE). 
• Adopted by The League of Imams in Liberia for use in Koranic schools.

1355,"Hello! 
* Training data set exchange between researchers:
Can you ask University of Cambridge to share their training data with you? They promised to do so while collecting samples in their Cov19 Sounds App (Appstore or play store, see https://www.covid-19-sounds.org/

Hi to Jan, I saw you asked EPFL. I just realized they are co-operating and exchanging their samples with Cambridge. Every one can contribute samples with the app on play store or App 
Still I think diversity is needed, as time runs out.

* Predictive power to severeness of possible covid-19 infection:
Please look at 
https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30732-3/fulltext
as it describes evidence that Post-Covid or severe course is related to ""irritable"" immune system, in undue shortening ;). This is prevalent to some researches in a high percentage of EU population like 17% but totally individually in manifestation.
(Common problems are lung problems like asthma, but hematoma from light (mechanical) stress due to changed coagulation and similar problems as well.)
I can tell from own observation that the real hard part will be to distinguish between irritated immune system alone, and one additionally suffering from covid-19, as the triggering event for MCAS can be anything, and symptoms then can be quite the same, up to dry coughs,  fibrosis of lung, O2 deterioration and wake-up gasps at night.
Perhaps one should ask people upon donating coughs to tell if they have allergies and other symptoms hinting on irritated immune system and ask them to describe in hind-sight if symptoms were related to other immune system overreactions or were indeed the beginning of a Covid-19 infection.

* Compute Power Shared?
Has anyone thought of creating some form of distributed computing environment? 
Perhaps the newer hardware with AI extensions could help out older models by donating compute power while charging (while watching device temperature).


* Stethoscopic Mode?
Can I contribute to extend recording to structure-borne noise with mobile phones?
This would be the attempt to do more than a stethoscope can do with almost any smartphone. 

 I would like to introduce the idea to combine low-frequency data  from the accelerometer MEMS chip with sound. 
Here I would like to select from the different microphones built-in, plus the external one on any cable-bound headset. The headset is offering the possibility to have live preview on the headphone for the user, and its microphone can record breathing sound, while the smartphone is in ""stethoscopic mode"" and could not catch the users breath while pressed to some body part for simultaneous recording.
(I'm not sure if an app has access to many microphones at once in android. Since MEMS accelerometers range up to a few hundred Hertz, it may well be worth while.)

Recording stethoscopic sounds:
I did so by creating or using some cavity around the microphone hole.  
If no cavity is there from some soft case, like the hole for back camera and microphone, one can cut out some O structure from an anti-slip-mat (for deposting small things in a car). One side is stuck around the mic hole, the other is made non-stick with some covering like rubber from single-use powder-free glove an can make skin contact.

I used ""Voice Record Pro"" by BejBej Apps, click Advanced, and  in ""record engine : advanced"" mode, then on level check, where you are able to select one of the 3 microphones under ""input source"", and, having cable bound headphones attached, to switch on ""Audio Monitor"" in ""Level Check"". 

Then I pressed the microphone to the skin until the air gets enclosed in the cavity and could hear e.g. heart beat or lung noise or noise in of throat breathing hiss through the bones around the paranasal sinuses and could detect inflammation from damping of high frequencies.

The iPhone8 will not be well suited, as its microphone introduces some artificial noise when the skin is coming nearer to the microphone, as if the MEMS regulation algorithm is disturbed by picking up Photo-Acoustic relaxations ;)
I had excellent success with an old iPod touch 4 and a good headphone, hearing the heart beat of my unborn child, but can not reproduce it, as I can not find the monitor-button in the app. I used it as a microphone-amplifier to just listen.
This is essential as it helps to find the proper place and good contrast for some piece of recording, and to hold it still without rustling and swishing.

 Upon interest I will check all kinds of mobiles/apps combinations you suggest to test for valuable results with while to process through ai.

I think that if the user would be guided in detail where to pick up body sounds, one would have a much more deeper and better to analyze, but in the first place faster to train data set.

I'm trained in telecommunications rather than deep in programming, but I will cope in both given some precise target.

I even could think myself in diving into 3D printing of TPU ""Stethoscopic Adaptors""  to produce high-quality recordings with proper fitting  clip-ons for the most prevalent smartphones. Perhaps even for the little mics in the cable bound headsets that smartphones are shipped with, as some recording engine could do audio recording with the external mic, while using the acceleration sensor for deep-frequency simultaneously recording of body vibrations.

See you!

1357,"I shipped a batch of respirators for user testing last week. Half of these are sewn from waterproof Cordura and the others are 3D printed from PETG. I will post the results from fit testing here. 

It was an extra challenge in keeping my workspace sterilized and sanitizing all of the materials and parts prior to shipping. The 3D printed components were soaked in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes and the fabric/headbands were washed in detergent and hot water heated to 60 degrees celsius. I tried steam sterilizing the fabric versions with an Instant Pot (pressure cooker) based on a study from the Cleveland VA Medical Center and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. The Cordura fabric I used to construct the masks survived, but the heat bonded neoprene tape I used to seal the seams and binded edges began to peel off. I purchased some better tape and will test it on another day.

Epidemiological Research Collaboration Opportunity
AIforGood Simulator team is looking for an Epidemiologist to collaborate on a research project. 
About the project:
We are building a web tool called AIforGood Simulator (https://www.aiforgoodsimulator.com/) for the charities, NGOs, and local grassroots organisations to model potential COVID-19 outbreaks in high-density low-income settings and displaced populations, such as refugee camps or urban slums. The simulator can help these organizations in preparing timely and proportionate response measures needed to control and flatten the curve of the epidemic of COVID-19 (and other infectious diseases) and reduce the number of fatalities. Soon we’ll be launching an interactive dashboard-tool that allows decision-makers to set the parameters of their camp &gt; run the simulation process &gt; assess the situation and deploy necessary interventions accordingly. 
Research goals:  
Conducting high-quality scientific research in infectious disease control in low-income settings and displaced populations;
Leading research proposals for academic and humanitarian needs;
Liaising with the team to coordinate research activities and develop plans for future projects;  
Peer review research papers and validate models with the leading humanitarian and epidemiology bodies (LSHTM, OCHA, JHU). 
Research experience: 
Infectious disease modeling experience, including literature review for best parameters;
Experience in diagnosing and validating existing infectious disease models; 
Familiarity with the COVID-19 modeling landscape and especially SEIR type of models;

1360,"I am looking into options for testing and thought I'd write a post about the U.S. FDA criteria for face masks, surgical masks and surgical N95 respirators. Regulatory guidelines in the U.S. for the last category are very strict and the FDA classifies them as class II medical devices. Manufacturers must obtain NIOSH certification, Premarket notification [510(k)] and follow Good Manufacturing Practices. An EUA can also be issued.

This document https://bit.ly/33Vqn1N outlines the testing criteria based on the categories I listed above. For any surgical N95 respirator design to satisfy basic criteria, it must pass a qualitative fit test (Bitrex aerosol test) , bacterial filtration efficiency testing (determines how effective the device/filter is at trapping particles), Air exchange testing (the measured pressure drop across facemask material), fluid resistance (provides an adequate barrier against bodily fluids) and flammability. The last criterion can be bypassed with adequate labeling. 

I don't believe any open source designs have cleared these hurdles, even at the EUA level, though a few are still trying. If you know of any, please comment below.

1432,"Congratulations to our JOGL colleagues in Berkeley!  They will go on to the finals...
Our Corona Detective's 'direct' results for the semi-finals were indeed as good as we suspected, with no false positives or cross-reactivity with other pathogens in the unknown samples, but simply not sensitive enough.  
(We finally got back our 'decoded' unknown set run for the semi-finals, but still have not had confirmation as to whether the reactions ran by our colleagues in Sri Lanka on concentrated samples were also considered when they evaluated our results, unfortunately.  A full analysis will come, after we get it all together...) 

Nonetheless, our push for more clinical validations and the triplex test is still happening; and we are certainly still very glad to be part of this big open science collaboration, with some of our quencher probes on their way to Berkeley from Paris already, to help for their finals' efforts.  Fingers crossed.  

Getting more easy diagnostic tests out, even as vaccinations are beginning, is still necessary, especially in resource-strapped settings...

1476,"I redesigned the filter enclosure to reduce airflow to allow the filter to better trap particles. N95 filters rely on Brownian motion for smaller particles under 0.3 microns since the pore size of the filter is larger than that. It forces the particles to travel a chaotic path and they become trapped within the fibers. I used Rhino and Grasshopper to write a centroidal Voronoi tessellation algorithm that generates the pattern. It is denser in the middle where the mouth is and I suspect that this should distribute airflow more evenly across the filter to eliminate hotspots and require less filter material. Waste reduction is an important aspect of this project.This has not been tested yet though. 

I printed this on a Form 3 SLA 3D printer. The second photo is the design in Rhino and the Grasshopper script used to create it. I love generative design for the aesthetics but I am thrilled when I can use it for a functional purpose. Parametic House and the Grasshopper forums were a big help in learning how to write this algorithm. ",4488,Hunter,Futo,2021-02-16T16:33:15.647Z

1575,"Apologies for some extremely late updates from our project:
- We developed a nasopharynx specific RT-LAMP primer set as an internal control. This primer set spans exon-exon junctions and is therefore mRNA specific. 
- Through the summer we ran some trials by shipping our cartridges to France and Chile. The results were promising in terms of stability of the reagents. In these trials, as well as in the lab at the Oakland Genomics Center we observed some issues with non-specific amplification products leading to some false positive results. To mitigate these errors we decided to sacrifice the sensitivity of Bst 3.0 for the specificity of Bst 2.0.
- We made up for this new lack of sensitivity by swapping out our primer set from the NA/NB set published by NEB at the beginning of the pandemic to the NM set by Broughton et al. In this respect the two JOGL projects ALERT and Corona Detective have been converging, the NM set was QUASRified by Guy Aidelberg from Corona Detective.
- We have furthered our collaboration with Fernan Federici and Cesar Ramirez-Sarmiento's groups at the Pontificia Universidad de Chile. We are particularly excited to switch out proprietary enzymes for those in the public domain.
- We also developed a magnetic wand for easy sample transfer into our reaction cartridges. 
- We also continued to present our project to various groups and events such as the gLAMP consortium, Global Community Biosummit and the Reclone Network.

P.s. Additionally The ViralALERT team was also chosen as a finalist in the XPrize COVID-19 Testing Challenge.

Over the last 50 years global average life expectancy has increased for 25 years, the path that was paved owing to modern and laboratory-confirmed diagnoses. However, pandemic COVID-19 has vividly demonstrated the failure of existing technologies to duly protect humans from diseases. The weakest point in this matter turned out to be an early recognition of a disease. A prime and simplest case in point is detecting the rise of body temperature for a couple of hours during sleep 2 days prior to manifestation of viral disease. It raises an issue to timely detect precursory symptoms of disease long before its full development.

2) Avoiding bias when collecting data. I've done UX research previously and it's very easy to introduce bias unless you hire an outside provider to facilitate. Even then, people generally want to be nice when evaluating new products. 

3) Decontamination testing. I would love to put on a lab coat and learn how to work with pathogens safely but I understand this is a serious undertaking with a lot of safety issues. Some feedback on this aspect would be great. Or maybe there's a way to prove that the device can be sterilized through already published research. 

The photo above is a technical drawing of the design. I drew most of it with Adobe Illustrator. It's difficult to show all of the details in a photo since I put a lot of effort into making the design look as minimal as possible. ",4488,Hunter,Futo,2021-03-24T00:06:34.643Z

1637,"I've been planning the healthcare pilot these past few weeks and this image is a high-level roadmap of the tasks I plan to complete. I've divided them into two phases and healthcare facilities can choose whether they are interested in participating in one or both phases.

My goals for Phase I are to document issues with current solutions relating to respirator design, fit and usage. I will interview front line staff that have worked with COVID-19 patients and ask them about comfort, safety and whether the respirators they wear have impacted their ability to do their job. I will also interview custodial staff and administrators to determine the burn rate for respirators and the costs for disposing them. Concurrently I will continue lab testing to ensure the devices meet regulatory guidelines, identify appropriate methods for sterilization and determine how many times the mask can be reused.

During Phase II I will measure the faces of front line staff and record their dimensions for data collection and to determine their mask size. I'd like to ship at least 50-100 functional prototypes with filters. I will test the donning and doffing procedure,  compatibility with glasses and other PPE and perform an A/B test between the new device and their current solution. Ideally I'd like to have them wear the device throughout a typical shift (though not around infected patients) and have them complete a survey afterwards. Then I will analyze the data and determine the cost per use, environmental impact and fit / comfort and safety of their current solution vs the new design. ",4488,Hunter,Futo,2021-04-29T21:48:19.876Z

1719,"📣 Hey Open COVID19 Fam! 🌍

You may have noticed that there is no GCC this week, but never fear! We’ll be back next week with a very exciting one that you won't want to miss. 😉

Next week, alongside giving space to all teams with a project update, we will begin a discussion about the future of the Open COVID19 initiative.

We want your help! 🤝
We’ll be sharing some of our plans and ideas, but we hope to hold an open, community discussion to learn how we may best support you all and help our community grow and thrive. 🌱

It would thus be great to to begin thinking about what you and your team would like/need most from the OC19 community moving forward and what kind of initiatives you would like to see taken by JOGL. 
We can’t wait to hear your thoughts! 🦑

The core agent interactions have been implemented in R and preliminary results are in agreement with the existing Matlab simulations. The total computation time is slightly longer for the R implementation (within seconds) which is to be expected as the simulations rely on various matrix computations. In the coming week, we will be continuing to test the R simulations with our existing results to verify the implementation and we will be looking to optimise our computational methods to reduce computational time, particularly for the large agent simulations.

Still, impact and new variants do seem likely to decrease and increase, respectively, before pub...   :-/
Surveillance screening may still be the only way ahead, particularly if vaccine coverage does not improve.
In some other good news, at least, a second video call with the 'at scale' experts is scheduled...  Hoping the MM* for the PoP** batch will be easy to organise, and we will end up with enough reactions to put to good use (i.e. for regulators in Switzerland, 300 tubes are basically the minimum needed).

1) I've modified the test plan a bit to focus more on fit testing specifically and published a working version of a test plan that I will continue to update: https://www.notion.so/Test-Plan-4d50f51ad7784bef9b5b2587bc4891a1

2) I'm working with another developer over the next 3 weeks to develop v1.0 of the mobile AR app to do facial scanning and measurement. I'd like to collect as many high quality scans as possible to determine a) the accuracy of the app, b) whether healthcare workers are wearing the correctly sized respirator and c) collect feedback on its usefulness in fit testing. 

3) I am still looking for volunteers that want to help with research, specifically to provide feedback on study design and data analysis. It can be as little as a quick zoom call, or you can stay on for the duration of the study. Get in touch if you are interested and would like to help. ",4488,Hunter,Futo,2021-07-28T18:42:58.128Z

Clinical validation tests in Ghana and Chile are promising, with no false positives and reliable detection on RNA samples already used for rt-PCR (down to about Ct25). However, the latest tubes sent to Sri Lanka are still stuck at customs, and their lockdown extended, too.  =( 
Additionally, we finally are looking forward to getting a 'proof of principal' batch of reactions from a company that could really make them 'at scale' for distribution, EVIK in Canada.

1968,"Had a bit of a dilemma, justifying to myself a trip by plane somewhere. 365kg of CO2 rather than by train. However its impossible by train in reality.

Justified this by suggesting its 38lb or 17kg CO2 sequestered by a tree in youth per year, therefore if you can let 20 little trees grow and then either be replaced by other trees from then on or continue then the CO2 net is 0.. 

But how do we literally offset this area and keep it like this and how much would it cost? Ive seen offsets of £6 for this C02. but this is almost impossible. 

if 160 trees are in each hectare depending on the land then for 20 trees ill need to guard this 0.125 hectare area.. and buy it forever locked into the planet.. if we take the land trust which itself is a little colonial but at least gives this option, thats £115...  Does anyone have any good lectures or ideas on this dilemma and its issues? Can you justify air travel with an offset like this?",101,Chris LB,Graham,2021-10-08T18:52:44.180Z

Free tickets at https://bit.ly/30FSq6D 

Rethink the deployment of global respiration technology. Help save millions of lives!

Jan. 29th (Sat.) 10:00 AM CST to 1:30 PM CST and
Jan. 30th (Sun.) 10:00 AM CST to 1:30 PM CST, 2022

Format: 3.5 hours of 20-minute presentations and discussions with thought leaders, followed by 1.5 hours of additional social interaction in smaller groups.

The Webinar Zoom link is: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82429125951, but please register so we have an accurate count of attendees.

The conference will have a Slack channel, additional video chat rooms, and specific activities designed to foster conversation and forge connections between all participants!

Humanity needs to improve the delivery of respiratory care medical devices globally by democratizing their development, production, deployment, and servicing. By using greater transparency, open-source techniques, and shared cooperative standards, we can build an open ecosystem of respiratory care medical devices which will save millions of lives in the next ten years.

We seek to empower firms, big and small, in every nation to use safe and effective, modular, repairable, free-libre open source designs to manufacture life-saving medical devices and PPE.

This conference will focus on making personal connections: between students, mentors, engineers, entrepreneurs, investors, business people, clinicians, non-profits, and philanthropists.

The conference will address the entire lifecycle of technology, from conception of the device, all the way to the lungs of a needy patient.

Special programming in the afternoons will focus on topics of interest to students.

1) this PoP is stable for at least 7 weeks at ambient temps (up to 35 degrees daytime temps here in Switzerland a few times), and
2) virus in a weakly positive (by antigen self test, the day before collection) saliva sample can be stable (untreated) for more than 6 weeks at 4 degrees.  
(Surprised, although maybe others have data on this!)

On Monday, I hope to do some of my first tests of Swiss clinical samples (blinded) with some PoP strips that are also at room temperature in our community lab (no air conditioning!).  
If all goes well, I may get to do the 200 positive/100 negative, necessary for most regulators...  Awaiting news from our Ghanan colleague, too!",671,Rachel,Aronoff,2022-08-19T09:42:54.285Z

Especially interesting will be to see how Fernan's lab's 'homebrew' enzyme batches will compare to tubes freeze-dried in Canada with commercial enzymes... 
Results of our clinical validations here in Switzerland will be put together with these latest and previous tests and those of Sammy in Ghana by spring we hope.

We could try to apply it on this data, but I think that the dataset we are using is not large enough. We only have country-level data, so that means around 220 values at maximum.  
To give an example, Current account balanceas an index for the economic situation in a country has 73 missing values, of the 264 rows. An additional complication with this data is that the rows are not always referring to a country, but regions are listed as well.

3687,"<a href=""/user/5"">@marc</a> no problem, I will try to explain in a few words what ""Fuzzy Logic"" is and how why I try to apply it here. 

The method has been developed by Lotfi Zadeh [1965] to make decisions based on imprecise and non-numerical information. The first step when applying fuzzy logic is the fuzzification of the data, to create a membership function which converts the original data to an interval [0,1]. When the new value is 0 then the value has no relationship to the set, and if the new value is 1 then there is a very strong relationship.

In this particular case, I want to describe the relationship a parameter has to vaccination risk. Thus, when there is a strong relationship with the risk that you might not receive the right medical aid in a country [because there are not enough medical workers] this country will receive a value close to 1, and reverse, when there is a very good medical service [with many medical workers per capita] the value drops near to zero.

So, when we do this for all the parameters in the assessment we can equally rate them, or use an expert to rate, and the use this input in a multi-criteria analysis.

This is very brief and short, I could do a short lecture on this topic if there is interest for a broader explanation.",218,Gijs,Van den Dool,2019-11-28T16:49:44.278Z

Your PoC idea is solid, however, at its current state it seems inaccessible to a non-expert public. I think a good step would be to identify your target audience for a quick prototype without including user data yet. Be careful with the use of the word risk in a statistical vs common langage.
I recommend making the sources of your initial data known. 
Can this approach be scaled up to any type of vaccine, and how do you deal with sparse data in specific countries?
Its a great idea to have an website accessible to all to assess these disease risks!",454,Selim,Ben Slama,2019-12-15T16:37:15.852Z
3697,"Thanks <a href=""/user/454"">@SelimBenSlama</a>,
The data is available in a GitHub repository, but we didn't add the documentation or listed the sources [we are working on this], this will be one of the actions in Phase 2 - if there is enough interest in a product/web service like this. Perhaps this also answers your concern about the visibility of the project, finding a landing place and finding the audience is planned early in Phase 2 as one of the first things after a ""Go"" decision.
The main idea behind the tool is that users can add their own data to the system, either more global dataor regional dataas long as the sources added are matching the boundaries. So, for now the tool is set up for country level data only [one row of data for each country], and when a data element is missing either the value is set [manually] to the maximum, minimum, or average value of the dataset - this is one of those expert decisions and the choice will be recorded; ideally, you want data for all rows in the dataset.
Hope this clarifies some things, and more than happy to chat more about this tool on and offline.

1.Geolocating tweets: The initial dashboard was not taking into account geolocation of tweets however the second version using an ELK stack does account for geolocation as demonstrated in the updates.

2. Multiple languages: Unfortunately at this time the module I'm using for sentiment analysis is based on English lexicon and therefore not able to parse sentiment from other languages resulting in a polarity score of 0. This is something we may have to look into perhaps by creating language-specific trained classifires. .",28,William Kane,Olwit,2019-12-10T17:32:55.916Z

I have not looked into the updates, please be aware that geolocation is very dependent on the settings of the user and the service. The results should be aggregated to low resolution before further analysis. This might not be a issue for the problem you are trying to solve, but something to keep in mind.
I think focusing on multilingual analysis of the tweets will be more beneficial.

4) If you want to add code, fork from the branch develop and merge request to the branch develop! Any request to master or staging will be automatically rejected.

https://www.blog.google/products/search/making-it-easier-discover-datasets/
Concluding with: ""A search tool like this one is only as good as the metadata that data publishers are willing to provide. We hope to see many of you use the open standards to describe your data, enabling our users to find the data that they are looking for."" which I completely subscribe to, and made me think of a standard search tool, or guidelines, and I think that there is no general ""one-solution-fits-all"" approach possible. 

I also looked at the documentation, and found the link: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset
https://schema.org/Dataset
Datasets in the Google Cloud are stored as ""A body of structured information describing some topic(s) of interest"", but I have the strong suspicion that not all the fields listed in the schema are filled, which makes the standardisation of search protocols an exercise with a low RoI (in my opinion).

But there is value in exploring the google dataset storage because  there are required properties, and one of them is the distribution.contentUrl, which means that all datasets in the google cloud can be saved as a local copy and used in research (if the rights allow this; another required property)
 
I am not sure what I can do next and would like to discuss this in a broader group.

3823,"Hello everyone! New to the project; my name is Ben.


I am currently in touch with an expanding circle of professors at MIT about this subject, and they perceive the need and are interested in pursuing this. We are in the very early stages of discussion, but it is highly likely that we will frame this as a Challenge to student body teams in Engineering Programs around the globe, with a centralized Open Source design repository. 

Undertaking an effort like this-to really be effective-has to address a number of far reaching design criteria beyond the device itself, which already will have to be adapted for local demands, available supply lines, and resources. Our ultimate aim will ""probably"" be to put in place all of these parts, along with assembly team instructions and sourcing information, so that if needed local teams led by Student Engineering teams who are already familiar with the design concept and specifics can lead on site manufacturing. These may take some specialized knowledge to produce parts of, and students are ideal for the purpose because-within engineering programs-they already have it and are unikely to go ""down"" as a workforce as hard as people progressively older or less healthy.

I have not looked through your documentation yet but will as soon as I'm able. The academic effort is in what I would define as ""lets get our shit together and do this. Its important"" but efforts have not yet formalized. I will update you as I receive updates, and see if the community wants to centralize here or on an institutional platform. It would seem this community is largely based in Europe? Is that accurate?

This project and members interested in participating should remain associated. Don't shut down because of Umbulizer and earlier efforts (there was another MIT version done ten years previous). This will have to undergo a fair amount of redesign and thought for supply and production chains, and we will also need to war-game out actual hospital and national emergency reserve supplies of ventilation equipment as best we can. In some cases countries have 10's of 1000's of units in storage for this sort of emergency. Obviously designing for those regions becomes less of a priority, as the issue shifts to staffing for them. 

My suspicion is we will be designing mostly for Africa and the Middle East, and possibly South America.

Please stand by-I will be back in touch with as much information as I can as soon as I can!

3859,"from the colorimetric lamp protocol preprint, for info, here is what is normally done with patient samples:   
Briefly, respiratory specimens (swabs) collected from patients admitted to 
various Wuhan health care facilities were immediately placed into sterile tubes 
containing 3ml of viral transport media (VTM). The medium constitutes Hanks balanced 
salt solution at pH 7.4 containing BSA (1%), amphotericin (15 Î¼g/mL), penicillin G (100 units/mL), and streptomycin (50 Î¼g/mL). The swabs were deactivated by heating at 56 Â°C for 30 minutes in a biosafety level 2 (BSL 2) laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Zhengdian Park. Due to the possibility of generating aerosols, the samples were allowed to cool at room temperature before further processing. If the samples were not for use immediately, they were stored at 4 Â°C.",671,Rachel,Aronoff,2020-03-15T09:37:19.099Z

3896,"Bonjour Emma, le projet Helpful Engineering est un ambitieux  projet de R&amp;D autour d'un respirateur en DIY, en fabrication rÃ©plicable facilement. Ici il s'agit plutÃ´t de venir en appui de faÃ§on beaucoup plus modeste grÃ¢ce aux impressions 3D de piÃ¨ces de rechanges et  la fabrication de petit materiel utile  (et de protections aussi) pour les soignants en coordonnant la communautÃ© des possesseurs d'imprimante 3D et de makers. Une sorte de chaine de solidaritÃ© spÃ©cialisÃ©e + repair cafÃ© destinÃ© aux hÃ´pitaux. Avec un inventaire des initiatives et des solutions trouvÃ©es. Le CHU de GenÃ¨ve a par exemple un de ces respirateurs en panne. Un des membres de ce projet se propose de se rapprocher d'eux pour dÃ©limiter leur besoin. En agrÃ©geant une communautÃ© suffisamment rÃ©active, en documentant et en mutualisant les ressources et process,  on pourra peut-Ãªtre aider les soignants au pic de la crise. L'idÃ©e c'est d'Ãªtre  l'Ã©coute des besoins des soignants et de mettre  disposition une communautÃ© maker pour trouver des solutions adaptÃ©es avec les moyens du bord. Ce projet va dÃ©j exiger le partage de beaucoup d'informations. L'agrÃ©ger au projet HelpFul Engineering risquerait de noyer les contenus des 2 projets. Par contre nous allons crÃ©er des ponts bien sÃ»r.

Pour ce qui est des masques, oui bien sÃ»r, il y a effectivement beaucoup de liens dans le PAD, et c'est vrai que toutes les plateformes sont lentes. Je vais tÃ¢cher de recopier les liens ans ce projet.",1526,Catherine,Villeret,2020-03-16T18:08:59.609Z

If there is no cash prize associated with this, I suppose some manufacturers will take the design, produce the masks and sell them to the government. I am all for open source, but I'd like to know if this group has thought about the effects on collaboration of the idea that someone some day may profit from this collective effort.

It is also well known from Woodward chemistry a long time ago (chloroquine synthesis ) that toxicity being an issue (Raoult talks of 600 mg p day not 100 mg together with the macrolide azithro that spiramycine would replace as well)
I would suggest 
1)you do a quick search with plant screening pharmacol on Pubmed NIH You might cross with plant chemicals of barks/ plants of geographic interest and knowledge 

2) thereafter contact spÃ©cialists such Maria Teresa Batista (she might be locked down in Lisboa or very busy in STP where internet is not always available but shes likely to give you better directions.
3) as the disease knowledge increased I suggest you might as well include free radicals scavengers containing plants with immuno modulating properties ( serious papers not junk that is on internet) as the target besides ACE and tmprss on cell membranes is the h+ ATPases dec , the keys to  transmembranes flow that controls in turn various intracellular systems including direct key immune processes AND potential resistance to the virus, regardless the specific target the drug is aiming at, thus those would act as potentializers of any effective drug. Moreover I understand that traditional medical experience is very deep in plant association and preparation ...

I am Juanpe, from the project 'survivorSerum'. I contact you to ask you if you still want to contribute to the project.

The thing is that it seems that survivor antibodies may be a treatment. Although we don't see or read any facts of transfusions. Just research and clinical trials. To me the point is: if it may be a treatment, let it be used! How could we help hospitals or stakeholders to put it into practice sooner? by gathering knowledge, protocols, warehousing recommendations, etc?

For me it's worth trying even if it doesn't help. Hope it helps though!

After thoughts, the simplest think seems to identify spatial correlation with the spread map of the virus. However, the data are probably not easy to get, since the low number of tests. That way, having a daily or weekly report of the number of suspected cases in several hospitals or dispensaries in the country can be used as a sample.

Then we can try to find correlations with other data as the presence and the use of  Neem (which is already present in Burkina and traditionally used).

What do you think about this?",4334,Etienne,Dupont,2020-04-21T12:57:37.577Z

4047,"Once upon a time, 3 years ago, for almost 1,5 years I also searched for something that is :
cheap and 
available and 
effective and 
safe and 
transparent (protected agains structural corruption). 

Call it Humanistic Intervention.  
(I formerly called it democratic, but I see people erect their fences when hearing this crippled and tortured word). Suggest other labels, please. Important is the boolean logic AND &amp;&amp; chain :)!

So apply these conditions to face masks and shields. You certainly make them affordable and cheap. 

The illusion of safe and effective for me was blown away with the negative efficacy of all those measures, also masks. 

Of course, crisis management should be all about risk compensation. If you have some immunicompromised, I later develop ideas what potential seeder (caregiver) and recipient (patient) or vice versa can both do. 


Without citing lengthy papers, for them, see below 7 reasons for that, the argument runs:

The less antigen (non viable or sterilised parts at best!) we exchange, 
 the less trained antibodies we have, 
  the more ill we finally become, and 
   the more we postpone endemic state, 

(as also by ALL measures and the disinformation of the mighty, aka fear porn and propaganda,
 =&gt;
 directly reducing nK thus 
   prohibiting trained innate antibodies thus 
    preventing sterilising immunity thus 
       herd immunity thus 
         endemic state

(this chain shall hold up for all ADE capable pathogens, as known since 40 years or so, the only viable immunity is by mucosal trained innate antibodies, preventing the _need_ of B-cell based antibodies through deep infection!)  

(It includes all detrimental measures like WHO-approved, CDC-propagandized inverted hygiene rules just so distorted that effecting _enhanced_ spread in waves: at home most infections take place. No-one (except Prof. Klaus-Dieter Zastrow early on) proposed something antiviral, topical or systemically or in the air, for the poor humans infecting their beloved ones. 
1,5m is a lie. Droplets fly 3m, and hover in tge aur, needing 40 SECONDS to slowly sink down, and ONE droplet is 100% infectious. 
Sneeze to elbow is a lie. 70% of droplets just get reflected and infect AROUND THE CORNER. Problem of face shields as well. 
Protection of self or others (Sneeze, cough into) masks is a lie. The masks always have places around the skin contact line where they do not fit smugly, THERE droplets can fly in and out. (Do the test by droplets by spraying with medium pressure, inhaling and exhaling it in a dark field setting, if you like with UV light and UV marker nasal spray). 
Cool hygiene rules would state:
Masks do protect only 1% without reliable statistics. IF you use ine, di not feel safe. Do PRESS the mask to your face by both pointing fingers and thumbs without gaps,  if you sneeze or cough or got showered by droplets, also close eyes meanwhile +40sec. 
Immediately after placing droplets, and after 1/4 hour of wearing, DO spray your maks by inorganic antiseptic sprays (CIO2 200-700ppm, I2 stab. 100ppm, NaHClO(800ppm), H2O2 (0.1-3%), or saNOtize, all working perfectly for mucosa sprayed or inhaled. Also, any NO generator in hospitals would end any respiratory and if higher and below NOAEL dosed by systemic symptoms from any infection by one-celled or smaller pathogens, holding true for all inorganic antiseptics mentioned above.  

Always spray, breathing in, to nose AND throat, and one under the tongue, as 1/5ths start in saliva glans, 4/5ths in respiratory RING, and only 1% (for non-smokers) directly in nose or (tracheal part mostly) of the lungs, even this accessible for 1 day to 10x hefty breathing into lungs a puff of inorganic spray as droplets based upper respiratory care. It will not reach alveoli, so even 700ppm CIO2(aq) is useable to good results. Get a real inhaler and eg NaHClO (like Plasm@ Liqui* mouth rinse solution 800ppm from pharmacy or dilute some with dead sea or stone salt water from your dentists supply) asap if feeling some infection sliding down from throat to vocal cords and down.

(I observed my reality was multiple times turned over, and now I dig into the philosophy of the ckncept of reality, and read Mattias Desmet: The psychology of totalitarianism, as a bad case of cognitive dissonance prevented me from seeing self-evident truths shining up my face. And watch the videos from the conference of humanistic hippocratic physicians and researchers there: archive them!

I now resort back to I know that I know nothing and Saint-Exuperys Listen to your heart, well the little pronce said, one can only truly see with the heart. 

And I attribute every being in our society of humans some role we play, and the sum of roles make up the story of humans. Right now this story is very distorted, and the ATTENTION we give to the bad things even rises the detrimental effects! It would be necessary to do magic by deliberately NOT doing Magic as in Terry Pratchetts Equal Rites. To deliberately NOT be part of moloch. Be part of something humble like humans. 

See 
Moloch Defined: 
https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/moloch-defined

 
My contribution could be 
Virtual Masks that work &gt;90%.
Here a paper for 100% that of course was severly critiqued, strangely enough fir formal things like consent of participants, and not the key point of having measured 100% protection by 5 times a day one drop of glycerine with 0.06% lvermectin solved in it. 
See https://c19ivermectin.com/carvalloprep.html

My opinion is that especially for classical mask cases like surgery a virtual mask combo spray from inorganic antiseptic, long-term acting additive like essences like cineol, and prebiotics like xylitol, one can top the protective effect of masks if accompanied by also spraying/ inhaling with the patient, and for surgery, regularly or continuously nebulising or spraying the open wounds with inorganic antiseptics and while surgery letting a dry fog eg hypochlorite nebuliser (called room disinfection machines, with admission, also for people staying insides the room!) run. They are programmable to room number, size, document usage, and even could make a big disco floor safe like 500mÂ²). Just get informed consent you may use one any time. Include Side note: You could walk out with less viable pathogens and may not infect others for up to the incubation time. If you find this disturbing, please leave now.  :)
Technology of NaHClO nebulising was used in military hospitals in Spanish flu and in bunkers ventilation to prevent spread of respiratory illnesses (civilian buildings, thus valid and admitted procedures in archives!).  

Still not every earth inhabitant has access to some nebuliser to protect or treat the lungs, also systemically effective in proper dosing, see Dr. Thomas Levy An at-home treatment protocol using H2O2. 

I suggest 3D-printing clever low-pressure nebulising heads.  Air pressure could then be used from bike air pumps, balloons as stored compressed aur, like tires, or old gas bottles, but air has to be filtrated like in a pipe filled with mask cloth and carbon to catch out eg. oil aerosol from technical pumps. 

I have a Cn inhaler (battery driven, pearl.de (crap as inner nebulising insert that ducts up fluid by Bernoulli underpressure to air nozzle point, was not able to withstand 100Â°C  from cooking water needed for disinfection, though manual stated I shall cook it) using a setup to nebulise particles with a median of high diameter (thus low energy or pressure need)  and then separating them cleverly by spinning the flow by a vortex structure insides the head of 4 fan-like blades but steeper angle, so the bigger droplets get sorted out by centrifugal force and drip back into the inhaling fluid. The median of emitted nebula is then the nice 5 Âµm range of alveolar well-resorbed particle size range.  

I hope I am not overloading your capability of adoption to the reality perception of fellow people having come a far way from mask-fetishistic, vaccinated and measures-compliant obedient citizen like me to some % awakened, but unsuccessful promoter of true interventions that shall be humanistic, at least self-transparent especially.  See the top 5 points here. 

Tell me what you think!

To make use of this treasure is as easy or hard as to open the eyes of the ones working together to recognise narratives we incorporated to be not part of our true reality, but rather being implanted foreign objects we should develop immunity against.

4112,"Hi <a href=""/user/5023""><span>@</span>Steve TchuentÃ©</a>. Very ambitious project, and various aggressive timeline! What is the current team composition? It seems as though you're suggesting that you mostly want someone with a software engineering background who has some exposure to machine learning (i.e. there is already ML expertise on the team)? Is this accurate?

Is the project open sourced anywhere? The demo seemed to me like a InVision/Framer prototype, but I'm very impressed if that got built in a hackathon!

As someone who has spent a lot of time thinking about bias and objectivity in ML/information retrieval, I'm very curious as to the current approach being taken. Are you actually using a knowledge base (i.e. is there an ontology / graph structure?)? Or are you using semantic search of some sort?",3575,John,Urbanik,2020-05-28T23:29:39.874Z
4113,"Hi <a href=""/user/3575""><span>@</span>John Urbanik</a>, Thanks
Let me go point by point.
1) Yes, your understanding of our need is accurate. We need someone with knowledge in Node.js, Python and Machine learning, because this is the direction we are taking.  For now, the prototype v0.2 back-end engine use keywords matching &amp; NLP to categorize incoming messages and query our existing knowledge base. 
2) Yes the demo v0.1 was built entirely the MIT Hack. 
3) For more information, <a href=""/user/5031""><span>@</span>Nana Kwame Owusu</a> is the current project Software engineer who developed our first version of backend engine. If you want and are willing to know more and contribute, we can set a call with him. :)",5023,Steve,TchuentÃ©,2020-05-29T08:01:38.756Z

4211,"Hi Nico, Great to hear from you. Funnily enough, we too wondered about using yeast for expression given the global brewing capacity in microbreweries but we're starting in E.coli. Bst enzymes are open sourced from ADDGENE or via the Ellington lab in Texas. Presumably you would need to clone them out of the existing plasmid for E.coli expression and into a S. cerevisase (carlsbergensis?) expression vector. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/saccharomyces-carlsbergensis I'm not a geneticist/molecular biologist so don't know if there needs to be codon optimization or anything else to switch from E.c to S.c. Very interested to see how this might work so please let me know how you want to move forward with this.  ",5942,Keith ,Moore,2020-10-24T02:45:13.303Z
4212,"Hi Keith, I have some genes including polymerases for PCR and LAMP and reverse transcriptase on the way from FreeGenes, currently they are codon optimized for E.Coli. I'm going to first try cloning them as is, codon optimized for E.Coli into the yeast genome using the strategy outlined on the project page. Then I will try using that yeast as a cellular reagent in PCR in place of Thermostable DNA polymerase. If that yeast, with the E.coli optimized polymerase works as a cellular reagent in place of conventional purified polymerase in PCR reactions and is able to detect low levels of DNA, I will try adding in the e.coli codon optimized reverse transcriptase, following the same strategy, then try RT-PCR. Then I will try using Bst pol for LAMP. If the E.coli optimized genes don't provide high enough expression levels to work in place of purified polymerase, I will have yeast codon optimized versions synthesized and try again. ",3881,Nico,Crudele,2020-10-24T14:57:15.554Z
4213,"Hi Nico, Sounds like a plan! So you are going down the route of only partially purified 'cellular extracts' rather than the biochemists conventional 'purify to homogeneity' approach? If that can work without carry over of (specific or non-specific) PCR inhibitors and DNases/RNases then that would be fantastic..... or there might be a half-way house that is a simple Ni-NTA column.  Does anyone recall seeing a paper describing an alternative to Ni-NTA -- not just the swap to Ni-IDA but a completely different resin? I seem to remember coming across it on my internet travels but can't find it. ",5942,Keith ,Moore,2020-10-25T08:20:56.767Z

Yeah that is my plan to start with. I'm going to try the cellular extracts approach first, and depending on how that goes may do further purification.

The problem with our enzyme structures is, that about 50 residues in all *.pdb strucutres (app. 10% of whole protein) are mutated (you often need that for e.g. crystallization purposes). So we thought, why not try comparative modeling? It failed obviously :D We try a different road.

You would need to analyse the GET or POST request to loop over dates and pollutants to retrieve all the data, while waiting for a few seconds between two consecutive requestions, it will take very long (365 x 4 seconds x  8 years x 13 pollutants / (3600x24) : 2 two days of execution time ! data should be stored as soon as it is downloaded) but this data is then very useful I guess to explore the relationship with cancer",275450,Edouard,Debonneuil,2021-11-06T21:59:37.246Z

However i) one has to find the population in these large cities but this shouldn't be difficult with a simple google search for each of the 13 cities (with the reference listed, at least the url) ii) one has to scrap this website to retrieve all that is needed.

Here is a scrapper for this website, developped some time ago at department level rather than city level, so  to be adjusted:

4464,"Ok there are 2 datasets:
- Y from 1990 to 2018: https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-et-traumatismes/cancers : here you download it once (search for ""Donn"" to see the link)
- X : ideally for every department and year at which Y is given, we would like to have pollutant values for the same department and the 15 years before. 

For X, I had given you this link https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-temps-reel-de-mesure-des-concentrations-de-polluants-atmospheriques-reglementes-1/ but I see that it is only for 2021 (and I read that historical values should be soon available: https://www.lcsqa.org/fr/les-donnees-nationales-de-qualite-de-lair)

So two possibilities:

a) you take this X and suppose that it is was the same in the past years so that you just do Y[2018] = f(X). The trouble is i) that you have only a few departments on the Y side so it is unlikely you will get something stable with so many variables (clearly not with an old-fashing model like logistic regression or linear regression, perhaps with a random forest that uses bagging it can work) ii)  I see that these X files do not contain a column department so merging X and Y requires to associated things like ""Metz-Centre"" with a department: the data for that needs to be found, or it can be done manually to searching for the department associated with these locations as there are ""only"" 364 locations. The reference (at least the url) to associate locations with department should be listed and any doubt should be made very visible, so that we don't create ""garbage in, garbage out""
b) or find a better X. I would personnally look into MyDataBalls, if not then in sources listed here https://github.com/Epidemium/GeoStatus/raw/main/interesting_data_sources/EpidemiumArcheology.docx 

Then I think a randomforest (a regression method that can handle many variables) and associated importance variable analysis might be sufficient. This is I think something that a team could do, so if with the ones in Barcelona you want to create a project
 
If you are familiar with deep learning or have friends in Barcelona who are, and want to be savy, ideally all the Y values for a department and given year t (cancer mortality risks by age, gender, body location) would be derived from a few nodes (a few in order to constrain the model to make sound predictions and not predict mortality by age randomly typically; so the shape of the deep learning model is a bit like an autoencoder), themselves derived from all X values for the department over the fifteen years before t and well as age and gender. But such a model is very very long to calibrate. A randomforest or XGBoost model should give a very good vision of how to use X to predict Y, compared to the effort it takes.",275450,Edouard,Debonneuil,2021-11-06T21:31:47.347Z
