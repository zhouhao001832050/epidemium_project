3,Cant wait for todays launch Yes,yes with pleasure what about tomorrow,Awesome Bravo cant wait,Looking forward to tomorrow and the launch of the CoImmune program on Vaccination Its going to be the first open research program of JOGL So much was built to get there so much is still to be built Still the beginning so thankful for having such a great team I cant wait to see what we can do together for the SDGs Welcome Welcome Thanks buddy Plenty of time to catch up in Paris anyway,Hey guy whats up Talking about you in my biosummit talk Awesome moment with the DIYbio fam presenting JOGL at the BioSummit Bienvenu Its tonight See you at the CRI Great work Hello Swann bienvenu Tu cherches aider un projet ou JOGL en general Beaucoup reste tre mis en place Tes retours sont prcieux Excellente fin de journe toi Avec la version actuelle de la plateforme le plus simple est que soit tu rejoignes le projet directement et que tu te prsentes sur leur feed ou tu crives un post en mentionnant le projet avec un et un des leaders avec le Ils recevront un mail de notification Tiensmoi au courant de comment a se passe,Hi there I believe you wanted to write skills instead of kills Fantastic ping,Awesome This is awesome Katja Welcome Benjamin Dont hesitate to add anything you think could add to the subject such as links to tutorials projects you like etc,,Thanks Great job,Hi if youd like to contribute to this project you are welcomed to share any links to articles related to the diagnosis of SARSCoV2 The goal is to identify and improve existing methods to make them as accessible as possible Hi everyone Ive just created the new project a hrefproject118OpenCovid19Testa The goal is to propose simple safe and affordable open source methodologies and tools to detect the SARSCoV2 virus behind Covid19 There is a need for accessible diagnosis tests for infectious disease in general Lets build a community interested by this approach Hi I believe this should be of interest to you Welcome to the project Thank you everyone for joining this initiative Next step we need to come together in order to know more about everyone here and who can do what Weve set this first call on Wednesday at 9pm Paris time We will use the following zoom room Looking forward PS If you cant make it let us know what time is usually best for you well try to accommodate everyone It looks like the virus has evolved into two different strains an older slower spreading strain S and a faster spreading newer strain L Population genetic analyses of 103 SARSCoV2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types designated L and S that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date Although the L type 70 is more prevalent than the S type 30 the S type was found to be the ancestral version Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020 Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly On the other hand the S type which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure Thank you everyone for such a great community call We had 15 people from as much as 7 countries for this 1st call France Switzerland Ukraine US Mexico Peru Ghana Its a very exciting start We have identified our first set of subobjectives that you can consult on the labnotebook of the initiative and put your name close to the ones you feel like contributing to more We are going to update the project description to include a link to the Slack of the project We also have recorded the whole session You can watch it on YouTube Lets teach the world how can an open and distributed community produce a realworld solution to an urgent problem Alarming news regarding the ability of US states to follow the evolution of Coronavirus epidemic The CDC says 6 states do not currently have at least one lab with the verified ability to run COVID19 diagnostic tests Alabama Maine Ohio Oklahoma West Virginia Wyoming Special iGEM What do you think of inviting iGEM teams to join the initiative and contribute What we could achieve would be even more grand Hi a hrefuser1286spanspanIntensify Worlda this is great Thanks What I would do copy and paste all this information in the About section of this project so that it becomes easier to read Dont hesitate to

community call for the OpenCovid19 initiative is today 6pm Paris time zoomusj7804345815 Hey folks Our next community call for the OpenCovid19 initiative is today 6pm Paris time zoomusj7804345815 Dear all With the OpenCovid19 Initiative we are currently running an opensource face mask challenge to identify all existing designs out there and have them evaluated by the global community and experts The goal Validate the really good designs and send them to manufacturers for production The good news We have already gathered more than 50 open source designs Now is the time to review all of them Please use this survey link and follow the instructions Dont hesitate to share the form around you especially to experts We need as much reviews as possible Deadline this Saturday Well share the results openly on Sunday with everyone Lets go Actually a lot can be found on this Hackpad dedicated to Covid19 All SARSCoV2 sequences are here Welcome Zach I think we should find labs who could run protocols for the benefit of this project Well equipped biohackerspaces will be needed Maybe Soundbio To safely test a particular design we need a nonviable part of the virus a DNA sequence for PCR assays or even a peptide though harder to obtain for protein assays JOGL is not yet equipped to manage parallel discussions of dozens of individuals Its good so far for sharing results updates and news about the project to a larger audience Google doc as a lab notebook if good enough for now if you have any viable open source alternatives Ill take it For discussion within the team Slack is a good option thats what we use at JOGL mostly This is great Thanks Charlie We should aim at differentiating between both strains when designing the tests we will announce the next call very soon Thanks so much Muhammad Welcome to the team Well be sending a form tomorrow to all the project members to assess what capabilities and skills we currently have at hands so that we can better organize the groups who will be working on specific objectives Thanks Kat for sharing this Its going to be really useful Very good points Xilia Thanks Cant believe its been only 10 days since the launch of this initiative It has already grown into a very capable community and Im very hopeful about the work well be able to put through together We have been working with and on how to restructure the initiative to facilitate the addressing of the multiple challenges of covid19 and accommodate the parallel development of several projects while assuring a real synergy between them See you all at 6pm Paris time

Follow this link to find the form where you can upload your video easily can I know more Hey we have really cool results Check them out Congrats a hrefuser671spanspanRachel Aronoffa,,,When openscience fights COVID19 I dont know where to start so much has happened since I last posted here I wanted to share with you some incredible news coming from the JOGL community participating in The OpenCovid19 Initiative we launched more than 7 months ago For context OpenCOVID19 is a communityled program designed to support open science projects and the creation of open source tools that can fight the COVID19 pandemic Back in February I initiated OpenCOVID19 with a call to my community to create an open source and low cost diagnostic test for COVID19 while our public institutions were failing at producing a tactical response to the upcoming pandemic It started with 10 motivated individuals So far we have now more than 4000 individuals who have joined JOGL and more than 100 projects are in active development in areas such as prevention education diagnostic treatment and public heatlh We could celebrate all those projects in fact I encourage you to do so by checking them on appjoglio or by following the JOGL Just One Giant Lab news But this time Im going to focus on just 4 projects I cannot expressed how proud and excited I am to announce that 4 of the COVID19 diagnostic test projects that the JOGL community has been working on in the last 6 months have been accepted in the semifinal of the XPRIZE For context these diagnostic tests are open source the only ones in the world so far and developed by JOGL community members coming from different countries individuals that never met before Projects collaborate with each other in synergy providing complementary approaches to the same problem Their tests rely on LAMP technology a DNA amplification method that doesnt need a costly PCR machine takes less than one hour to resolve is super cheap and so is super scalable Our partners at APHP had some very encouraging results using one of them Folks this is the proof that communitybased science and innovation not only works but is efficient and scalable Now these four projects are competing in the XPrize with much larger and richer companies startups and academic labs Weve been supporting them financially so far using our microgrant system more than 60 000 euros were distributed to more than 20 projects thanks to our partners AXA Research Fund and Vinci Foundation But we need more support If you are in the capacity to help us make open science win this fight against COVID please contact us to make a donation This is so exciting for the future ping a hrefuser28spanspanWilliam Kane Olwita ping a hrefuser28spanspanWilliam Kane Olwita,,,,Hey Folks

reach out to us We also invite you to read the About section and check out the Needs Assessing Health Systems Resilience has never felt more concrete and necessary than today Join us in this collaborative effort Within ClimHB we study both population health in mobility settings and health systems resilience in a context of climate change The interaction between these two dimensions can be studied through a Healthcare Access perspective As a guidance in our actual empirical work we have developed a Conceptual Framework adapted from Levesque et al Framework on Healthcare Access This is a modest proposal that we will test in the course of our project However in this perspective of open and collaborative science we wish to share our reflections with as many people as possible There are many ways you can contribute to our work For instance evaluating our Conceptual Framework dimensions and determining which dimensions interactions and links could be missing supporting the Conceptual Framework graphic design to make it more intelligible and make its interactive features visible We are looking forward to enlighting collaborations Take care Hey I could maybe help with that depending on the type of data you need And I can certainly find people in my network who could help as well Ping me on Slack so that we can chat about it Best Hey I would be happy to connect you pneumologists

had an amazing global community call yesterday You can look at the project updates here You can watch the recording on youtube here Our next call will be on November 4th 4 pm UTC Dont miss out,Dear community members Please take the OpenCovid19 anonymous evaluation form by November 23rd You dont need anything else than 10 minutes and a finger This will help JOGL improve OpenCovid19 and overall design and run programs tailored to your needs We designed this form for two purposes i Assess your global satisfaction regarding the OpenCovid19 initiative ii Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the program for open science project creation and development We have already adapted our community management strategy based on the responses we had so far Now we need more feedback to build the 2021 OpenCovid19 strategy and improve the overall JOGL operations JOGL will be matching 1 donation to DirectRelief for each response to the OpenCovid19 anonymous evaluation form Check out more info on Many

15,It was great to talk to projects and communities at the launch of JOGL event I attach our image from 28th June also Here is the link to the simulations from the project we discussed,welcome We did not see you in person for long time feel free to comment on the post if you have any questions about how it works or about the project itself Me and other people from Lecturers without borders Athanasia Nikolaou would be happy to answer your questions Comments from and Julien 1 if you ping people in the comment of the project or in the comment of community they do not get notifications Comments from Chetan Shibu LiuBov and Julien 2 can you delete my profile if it is not verified eg all nonverified profile like old profile liu bov Comments from Chetan Shibu LiuBov and Julien 3 where can I put the links of the project page eg if we have github repository facebook twitter profile etc for now if you go to the page of the community there are only SDGs but no other social accounts I guess this will be done in the future We also create a project from our community for collection the information about about schools and existing scienceeducational initiatives around the world It is citizen science project together with We will share the link to it soon There is new event from Lecturers without borders coming in Berlin It is organised by CorrelAid lab and City lab Berlin 2nd August Berlin Germany You can register here There is One Learning planet event during this week 2527th July at CRI Paris France We will be there also with other Lecturers without borders welcome ShirleyHE welcome to join There is also CorrelAid events in Hamburg Check it here or here Hey Check this one we have been working with colleagues from Mallorca institute where we analyzed transport in the ocean I should check if they have also open data on this Also here check the programs and data from our colleagues in the Netherlands,,We have several lectures coming in the following month Join us for Fete de la Science for Mendeleev lab with openlabacom lectures at CRI on 12th October This project is coorganised with Barbarar Bravi Openlaba project CRI and Cultural Center of Paris There will be more updates on this,Hey Next meetup with CorrelAid Paris is on JOGL x CorrelAid Paris hackathon this week Hey Github repository from CorrelAidParis with some data from the past hackathon The past projects we collaborated with are here Hey New meeting of CorrelAid Paris is this Friday at 18h30 at CRI lounge Everyone is welcome if you would like to learn more about the project do you know anyone who could help with that will there be any hackathons on education great do you need help with the code for your project,I think that people from CorrelAid community could help here Correlaid which we are coleading with Rahel Also check Humanitarian OSM which could be also helpful for local mapping actions if needed You can reach correlaid community of people here where we try to help with data analysis Happy to help Great project Hey Some of our activities from CorrelAidParis community The list of projects we are working with CorrelAidParis are listed in on the topics 1 Analysis of health data 2 Analysis of mobility data 3 Analysis of patients data 4 Analysis of citizen science 5 Analysis of educational data 6 Analysis of environmental data Visit repositories and projects of our colleagues for possible ideas for the projects patients community analysis of open citizen science data educational projects ecological projects Hey We are searching for internsvolunteers in Lecturers without borders More details in the project description page and our github You are interested in programming mapping and working in international team write to us Anastasia Mityagina anamityaginagmailcom Great When you are going to present the project There will be online meeting right,thank you Aral if you have any particular open problem in Turkey on this topic we would be happy to discuss but we now merged with other project on analysis of vaccination and twitter data,,,We would like to make an announcement due to the current situation with Covid2019 since we directly work with traveling scientists We are aware that the mobility of citizens is temporarily limited LeWiBo complies with those measures by suspending the organising of any further outreach lecture towards educational institutions and general public to countries without exception Thanks to an unprecedented widespread processing of information by both governments and citizens on this matter we are confident that optimal solutions of how to handle this will be found soon We will update as soon as the suggested policies change Until then we follow the rules of personal hygiene of WHO and wish you all to stay safe Some links to resources Keep on getting informed JOB ANNOUNCEMENT Are you passionate about science or education and willing to make a positive impact on society Lecturers without

in Ukraine here are english talks we are collaborating with them now wow so nice a hrefuser671spanspanRachel Aronoffa i am totally not from the field but looks really cool do you also do any science communication about your topic just asking because of Lecturers without borders project cannot tag the project in the comment for some reason a hrefuser2spanspanLuca Haenela yes tnx a hrefuser2spanspanLuca Haenela i wanted to tag Lecturers community indeed but tnx a hrefuser671spanspanRachel Aronoffa yes i meant the outreach as we are doing with on various topics or as we were working on in separate project a hrefproject216spanspanGlobal Free Webinars for Students a where scientists could present what they know about specific topic to school students Just your topic seems really beautiful and students could definitely all like it a hrefuser671spanspanRachel Aronoffa yes i meant the outreach as we are doing with on various topics or as we were working on in separate

good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,Hi everyone out there Looking forward to collaborating with you on this Hopefully we can build something great Great Launch event how do I include my needs to my project,Nice great to know,,The app itself can be accessed through this link check out this link to view the live twitter sentiment analysis and visualization concerning Vaccination,Exploratory analysis of tweets from 201811 on Vaccination globally Vaccination tweets analysis A preliminary dataset for exploration Ive created can be found here Feel free to download and explore it A sample study case would be a natural language processing model of the tweets Anyone interested in looking at the code for the project its at yes I definitely need some help I can share the GitHub repo for the source code and deployment Sorry I dont have notifications set up here so only just seeing this,For all the people at the sprint Im terribly sorry about the poor internet connection on my side The wifi where I was didnt have the best signal Please have a look at the source code shared on github and especially the apppy file in the repository to see how vader was utilized for sentiment anlaysis The function preprocess NLTk defines the steps that are used to carry out the analysis on the twitter data before feeding it to dash for visualization An update on overcoming the hurdle of getting twitter developer access The twitter developer access may be present a hurdle in accessing tweets for NLP analysis The second dashboard therefore bypasses the need for the Twitter API by using an OSINT tool for python called TWINT You can access the dashboard here and interact with it actively to change the different parameters and see the changes Hi pleasecheck again Ive made it public on GitHub so you can access it now great,This is a very well thought out project The use of a videogame as a visual and interactive tool for training and dissemination of informationon v vaccination hesitancy is great How do you plan on evaluatingassessing the transfer of learning by the different players Is the primary focus only on health workers or the general public as well A brief overview of our project the motivations behind it what we have done so far current and future work to come Video Description on YouTube Alternate hosting on Loom Attached PDF for offline review Hi this is true With sentiment analysis especially using algorithms like VADER and text blob that are modeled using reviews its challenge as some of our results will be skewed as you see in the example above It is possible to improve our algorithm or use a different one what do you and the team think There are a few algorithmsmodels we can use like BERT Let me know what you think Hi 1Geolocating tweets The initial dashboard was not taking into account geolocation of tweets however the second version using an ELK stack does account for geolocation as demonstrated in the updates 2 Multiple languages Unfortunately at this time the module Im using for sentiment analysis is based on English lexicon and therefore not able to parse sentiment from other languages resulting in a polarity score of 0 This is something we may have to look into perhaps by creating languagespecific trained classifires,Hi Joglers the project Qualitative analysis of tweets on vaccination is looking for volunteers to assist in manual labelling of tweets This will aid us in Natual Language processing of the tweets and in the generation of an AI model capable of classifying tweets for sentiment analysis Thank You Thanks for this Let me check them out,Happy New year Yes a bit late but all the same hope its going great Here is a small update on the project For anyone interested in having a sample look at the data heres a brief exploratory data analysis in Jupyter Notebook This is hosted on google Colab so anyone can have a look and play around with it This uses a subset of the data collected for tweets between 2006 and 2010 1 It should provide a brief look at what can be done with the data The Jupyter notebook is also attached below Hi please check now Thanks Great Hi Thank you for joining the project its great to have you on board Current Status We are still in the planning research and brainstorming phase We havent settled on a choice of blockchain but have a select number of use cases that we envision may be feasible Just from reading your bio I think your experience with the blockchain is perfectly suited to help to go forward Thanks and welcome,,Hi a hrefuser3571spanspanClment Pilona Sure let me share the Project drive folder here so you can help with that Please share your email with me so I can add you to it,,,Hi a hrefuser5226spanspanKank Ba yes I do can I share a guide and the repo with you Hi a hrefuser5226spanspanKank Ba yes I do can I share a guide and the repo with you Hi a hrefuser3883spanspanPauline Chanea sorry Ive been off the platform for a while due to work constraints However if this offer is still available id be happy to take it up with the project manager to go forward Hi Nidia thank you Ive responded to your email and will share the project repo with you,,,,,For access to

101,,Made a quick and one image take on the groups goal Here is a summary of the first step to this Goal using opensource software at PubPub in java containers mostly and this site itselfThis is the minimum level itd be nice also to have a separate system for a group of reviewers to use so only group admins could finalise and publish each article after a period of reviewing time Users would assign themselves to a group of papers that they can review This step would take a lot longer and is more complicated therefore isnt in the image A link to PubPubs GitHub has a very nice premade storybook of its code for testing Link to current for funproof of concept version of JOGLs journal extension This is the minimum level itd be nice also to have a separate system for a group of reviewers to use so only group admins could finalise and publish each article after a period of reviewing time Users would assign themselves to a group of papers that they can review This step would take a lot longer and is more complicated therefore isnt in the image You join JOGL make papers together and look for other projectsgroups youd like to help make papers in Then these are prepublished insite This would have the same mechanism for scientific review creation,JOGL peer review A Group starts the publication draft all those participating get a link Simultaneous publication editing by participants they can upload documents and all those who edited the document get an author tag with a voting system for share of creditauthor score The group organising the collaborators also get affiliation The group then submits this to the peer review pool along with key phrases or subject areas attached for automatic processing and submission to an open Peer review page on the JOGL website Members of JOGL with the publications affiliated phrases or interests in their special peer review interests section or who have published with similar phrases will get a notification or chance of notification to edit the work however a section of the website is dedicated to peer review and anyone can review the work However it can only be published if it has been visited or reviewed by members above a set score therefore ensuring quality review To ensure this is high to begin with proof of professorship or imported impact score from research gate or google gives a head start meaning initially those who already review can immediately continue reviewing After review peer reviewers authors and the JOGL group or project get an author score added decided by the number of slaps and website views the paper gets which is publicly visibletherefore everyone benefits from a new paper loudspeakerMembers of JOGL then get access to comment on this in a new page dedicated to only papers where it is archived and the paper is published The paper at any time may then be amended based on the wider publics comments by any of the reviewers authors or members of the public this amended papermust be reviewed again to be republished Therefore to achieve this we need A tool to make drafts of the papers A repository page to store drafts and allow commenting and reviewing openly A way to redraft a paper by the authors privately for resubmission A way for a reviewer to click that this paper is publishable A mechanism by which people receive notifications eg of author changes A mechanism by which a paper is published after a reviewer score limit is reached An archive where comments can be made to papers in the same way but the paper be locked but also this paper be searchable by google scholar for example The ability to likeslap a paper and this to affect the score of a user as a reward The ability for a score to be associated with a user perhaps with badges etc

groupe Open Paper Writing Peer Reviewing and Publishing Here is the presentation of our last meeting Voici la presentation de notre dernire reunion de groupe,,The most recent iteration of peer review goals at JOGL For those attempting this challenge Check out the DataDump Project and join our group for a database of Vaccination information also please add more documents and files We must concatenate the data Concerning the access to Vaccines challenge a resource of papers links and coding documents useful for future projects can be found on our about page Please comment if there are any interesting correlations found using the collated data and join our project if you find any new datasources then just add them to the page Team WorldHealthDataDump Ever more recent iterations of peer review Goals Good point Interesting new progress for update of the platform Will need to ask thoughts on peer review systems soon heres a schematic of currently half agreed implementation Have been making the design documents for alterations of the site to have a peer review capability Any thoughts on how we decide who the reviewers are Do we select them allow them to self evaluate or let anyone review but have some kind of moderation system,,This recent BiorXiv paper is interesting The FtsZ that so many peptidoglycan synthases interact with has a plausible method for peptidoglycan desposit with the rest of its interacting partners Perhaps something similar is happening with MreB polymerisation also We have created a google form to evaluate opinions on peer review in science Take a look fill it in and have your ideas heard This may change how JOGL is created,Bdellovibrio a new frontier in antibiotics coupled with Phage is extremely effective at destroying potentially pathogenic bacteria,A groundbreaking paper suggesting substrate isnt specific and changes activity in PBPs alters our understanding of antibiotics and 10 years of work This is quite insane AI driven discovery of antimicrobials This really shows how in silico and design based work is the future of AMR,Has anyone tried constructing an expression vector for antiCOVID19 antibodies A conjugate luciferase antibody as A non DNA based method no PCR would speed the detection a lot If someone has already published an antibody protein sequence then conceivably many vectors could be made and tested If as a community we dcided to These vectors could be screened for ab purification efficiency for instant screening downstream and high throughput purification etc When is the next OpenCOVID call on this for steps moving forward Is this a problem caused by COVID19 What people do you need currently Does anyone know any engineers interested in joining an initiative for DIY ventilators For future relief of COVID symptoms project here started by Join the project and slack channels Quoting the Helpful Engineer Slack bot Currently we are in need of medical professionals to become actively involved Please feel free to forward a Slack invite in the description to get them engaged Invite them to this project ask for admin rights or create your own project in JOGL if you arent looking to make a ventilator and need a place to centralise your helpful engineers project as here we can ask for more members and show needs These project pages are to keep the most valuable news show the current status of the project for sharing images of prototypes and to keep in touch with the wider OpenCOVID community Hey I heard there is an outcome of this is this familiar Announcement from Charles He Volunteer coordinator at ProjectOpenAir Note that as of this morning 5 AM PST 12 PM GMT were receiving a large surge of several hundred new members Typically this reduces coordination for a short period of time 24 hours as new people settle in Were working to intake everyone in an orderly way right now In the next few hours please expect an announcement on slack about next steps to develop plans for hardware and software devices Also right now we need category leaders people who are willing to survey and guide proposals across a large group of potential products in both hardware and software The important skills are listening and working across multiple teams servant leader Please contact me by direct message if you are interested To talk to us join our slack here Our new twitter if you are a company rather than person looking to help reach out to us there or message on our wall here The project is now in its proposal phase join on slack if you want to be a part of it we are writing 4 page well referenced proposals and choosing the best ones to continue forward Deadline Monday 2000 EST A quick summary of the project status Join us on slack here Our new slack link Join us here at our updated slack link Small celebration at another 2000 peoplegt Our Updated slack link New Slack link again Thanks for the support PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS Submit proposals using this form Deadline 3 AM GMT Tuesday March 17 8 PM PST Monday March 16 Note that proposals should be in the 4 page format described previously They should also be in a Google Doc format Please enter the link to the Google Doc as you complete the form Background With the support of many of you we have found large engineering regulatory and financial resources We intend to assemble and focus these resources behind a few high quality projects to counter COVID19 This is the fastest way to make a difference We will judge these proposals by their feasibility speed effectiveness and their inability to be easily replaced by other efforts We desire intensely for the entire process to be open and transparent We will post the proposals and tell you as much about the selection process as we can We will also try to use public feedback from members However direct voting is unworkable We have found a number of medical and industry experts to review the proposalsbut we want as much opinion as possible please contact us if you are an expert Immediate information we can give about the process Proposals collected by the deadline indicated within 24 hours or less of the deadline proposals will be made available to the public We will begin to review the proposals 96 hours after the deadline 48 hours more than initially announced we will complete selection Early decisions are possible Yes we are open to other rounds of proposals we created this early round because of the urgency to find proposals and teams that we can support with our resources For direct questions about the submission process please contact Chris LB Graham administrator We will post as much information as we can Besides what is posted there is limited information we can provide on the process No one has done anything like this beforeour focus is on results Helpful Engineering Team Open Peer Review For Proposals Helpful Engineering is developing simple and effective opensource products and designs to fight COVID19 These include hardware devices suitable for consumer production and mass manufacturing as well as important and pragmatic software products and systems We will continue the search for these projects in subsequent roundsplease continue your important work developing them We are reviewing the first round of project proposal submissions We received over 24 proposals that have passed an initial quality screen Both public feedback and an expert review with administrative involvement will be used to determine the outcomes We will provide a detailed report for proposals that make the final selection Below is the process for providing public feedback We request serious and sober thoughtyour input may affect many real world outcomes Public Feedback Process 1 Please find the proposals in this Google spreadsheet 2 Review each project using this form An initial screen removed a smaller number of proposals due to quality please PM Chris LB Graham for more information We choose not to make these filtered proposals available because names are attached to them Outcome of Wave 1 Project proposals Our peer review has resulted in the Offset ventilator short term O2 concentrator slightly longer term and Hardware PPE short term being chosen as our official hardware projects In addition the tube connectors project scored very highly in our review The best software project was the database for local manufacturers able to produce hardware due to its simplicity and high score in reviews Please have a read of this presentation for info why and what our review process was the following slides were shared with the administration team and made their final decision What will happen next As highlighted projects these projects will be given special treatment of focussed QA and facilitation by our volunteers they may get funding and will be advertised in our media as important This is the first round of review for specifically high impact low time investment projects and we encourage you to continue working to facilitate yourselves and produce the incredible projects and outcomes you are doing in any project Reach out to our team for any resources you need and advise There will be another wave some time next week with more technical emphasis and increased scope We are proud of our community and want to help you help yourselves and your local areas Congratulations to Stuco Nick Moser Douglas Keith Kenneth Yeung Brian RuurdMoelker we will be contacting you shortly Chris LB Graham Wave Two of Grant Application and Peer Review is Open After a very

deadline for the Grant application is Friday 1am 27th March GMT at which point the form will close and an open review will begin Call for Proposals for sampling swabs Doctors have called on us to source sampling swabs as there is a shortage If you would like to submit a project proposal for sampling swabs please use this template and submit this template to this form to Review process We will be reviewing the above documents through crowd sourced peer review again in a similar way to wave one To increase the effectiveness of this a more thorough peer review form has been made however we

out more and try and help This is so cool a hrefuser8spanspanCamille Masselota This is shared from our Hardware lead Mark Xu highlighting volunteer prototypes so far projecttemperaturedetection has a prototype projectoxygenconcentrator has a prototype projectpneumaticventilator also has a prototype Really proud to be part of this movement Please keep in contact with us so we can help you as much as possible This also doesnt include our Hardware PPE project which is doing very well also Hi At Helpful Engineering which is a project within the open cover initiative we have been collecting projects to review Please if you have time to review projects do so and encourage your team members to help Well done for such an extraordinary achievement Our Open Source Proposal repository If youd like to take part in our review process please do Public Feedback Process Open for 36hrs 1 Please find the wave two proposals in this spreadsheet 2 Review each project using this form For technical

Please find the wave two proposals in this spreadsheet 2 Review each project using this form For technical questions related to submissions please contact me Happy to help in lab protocol testing vector creation whatever the group focuses on as this project moves forward in a minor way I think this is a fantastic idea I hope I know an iGEM team that could take part I as a naive biochemist think this method could be almost exactly copied Except maybe including another swab subtype considering methods of testing for covid in stool If we just replace the reaction on the paper itself this really makes sense An RIDT type thing and use of antigenantibody reactivity would be a safe and quick test A post below suggests coronavirus antibodies already exist and we could maybe produce the conjugate antibodies from the existing literature But yeh we would need to test it though Which would be a little more difficult Just noticed your two sample remark Thank you for the links Checking out your trello Maybe we should link it in the project info I think you can assign admins in the edit project options along with adding images But you scroll a little further Cindy would be great as an admin here also I feel like the reddit thread could be somewhere to recruit helpers I also think needs can be added to the project which can attract people here Then possibly a meeting could be setup when there are enough people This is incredible I wonder if theyd fund a full self test kit no lab processing needed in similar suit our new link sorry added this to our info so its never lost I guess as you say It just needs to be built and relevant peoplemass producers contacted possibly Thanks a hrefuser948spanspanBenjamin Treuhafta sorry I couldnt reply earlier Please join us in slack or message here with any new info Its extremely helpful and we need more connection between groups I think we as a community are broadly in agreement We certainly havent shut down the group has surged in

put in place to support the community while waiting to find more funders for JOGL We expect projects to not ask more than 1500 euros each the smaller you ask the higher the chance you have to be funded We will prioritize projects that either 1 were already funded got outstanding results and need additional support or 2 unfunded projects that can do a lot with a small amount of funding If you dont need a grant you can also win visibility and have your project peer reviewed If you are interested PLEASE follow all the steps mentioned in this document JOGL MicroGrant and peer review Summary The deadline for this Round is October 18th 9am UTC Positively reviewed projects are more visible to the global community and can access the JOGL network of partners JOGL microgrants can amount to up to 1500 Euros aim smaller if possible to increase your chances Projects will have to use their JOGL project page to present their proposal so it will be transparent to everyone in this community One submission per project leader Your project will then be reviewed by other applicants and reviewers in the community and the results shared 8 days after submissions close Applications must be from open source projects Applicants must take part in the peer review process in their own time during the 8 day waiting period and will be emailed a link to review three other projects upon the closure of the round The application process is also open to the world so dont hesitate to share this to a project not yet part of the JOGL community If you have any questions please message me Good luck To help review the 12 projects that are applying for JOGL microgrants as part of the community process please use this link gt We rely on this crowd sourced feedback from experts and volunteers like yourselves to make funding decisions and you may review as many projects as you like You can see which projects have been submitted on the review form above dependent on your help If you are a grant applicant your team must ensure they have reviewed at least 3 other projects for funding eligibility The applications this time are all of very high quality this round so each make a good read They

Congratulations Whats happening next Congrats Dr Aidelberg Wow thats very efficient Why are you sharing the budget Hi Thanks for this join here Its a proslack plan so feel free to use it for your teams Have updated the link too thanks guys I may remove this it was recommended but many channels need archiving Dont worry about adding channels on Slack It is useful for announcements and instant messaging the team though it definitely wont be a problem no the only people who decide the outcomes are reviewers and reviewers wont be able to see that kind of thing just your JOGL page you will be a reviewer if you are applying Nice Hey try sharing this in a group or project a few groups would be interested in this such as open microbiology or open covid This looks really cool Join us on our

Africa but have come across a fundamental problem We need spare equipment to actually fill labs as many are undeveloped to the point of not being able to perform AMR screening If you know any labs with old equipment such as shakers bunsens petri dishes antibiotic discs media and glassware please let us know and email me here chrisjoglio The first set of equipment will go to a new lab in Tanzania a hrefuser622spanspanHarry Akligoha its worth a go P I love making models for proteins there are some alternatives perhaps iTASSER for example is great if just making simple mutations swissmodel is also good It was a great call see you in a bit,This is beautiful Gameli i cant wait to see our space We are almost there with our paper on the peer review process conducted at JOGL and how applicant to applicant review can work A big jump in democratising science We are going through the stats and confirming this is all perfect before submitting to a preprint However putting this unproofed addition here for open reading ahead of JOGLs second birthday a hrefuser3spanspanThomas Landraina a hrefuser191spanspanJust One Giant Laba a hrefuser5spanspanMarc Santolinia a hrefuser8spanspanCamille Masselota A tested model for an open and applicant driven grant allocation system We are making the curriculum this week which Harry has suggested be split into General knowledge in microbiology I think we need to specify here which microbes we are going to deal with Techniques involved in identification of microbes Sensitivity testingantimicrobial susceptibility testing Digital mapping amp using microbis antibiogo AMR stewardship I think we are going to add this to our new space and use the platform as a teaching toolhub itself For general microbiology knowledge would anyone like to help or have any ideas on what we can add to teach AMR swiftly to undergraduate students We will make this anyway and have a good deal to teach but its hard to see where we should go with general knowledge in biology a hrefuser622spanspanHarry Akligoha is there a set of 10 or so organisms we could make a tree of tests out of and teach for the general knowledge MOOC Dear All We have decided to start Global Community calls back up and make them bimonthly predictably every two weeks from 14th July 6pm CET Whilst we have common attendees there are projects that prefer working independently of course too Im reaching out to ask if you as a team or in other endeavors made any progress with your projects on COVID19 issues especially if youve been funded It would be fantastic to share your progress with us for our funders and the community Please comment if you have anything interesting to share or give me a message We are also looking towards directing volunteers to projects so anyone in need please comment Best wishes Chris Hey a hrefuser6947spanspanDr Linda Salekwaa and a hrefuser622spanspanHarry Akligoha we are currently working on the mooc here in google docs form ready to teach later Any help is appreciated Hi all We have our Global Community Call GCC especially for group leads to discuss current issues but also for new teams or projects to join in and find a place etc tomorrow 6pm CET on our zoom here Ill be hosting it so it will be perhaps extra scientifically focused We have also decided to change these meetings to every two weeks to let them be as predictable as possible so we will see you in two weeks too of course Therefore after tomorrow 6pm CET it will be 28th July 6pm CET and so forth If youd like to add any slides please do here really looking forward to seeing any progress and discussing ideas In the interest of progress and troubleshooting I think this time it would be especially interesting to hear from any progress of the recently funded teams and take notes for which projects need volunteers a voice in media or help in other ways An idea from the team has been to form working groups for project progression so discussing these needs will be important What do you think Continuing conversations of the panel discussions would also be interesting if we have time See you soon everyone looking forward to it a hrefuser4488spanspanHunter Futoaa hrefuser4977spanspanDavid J Castillo Cornejoaa hrefuser6650spanspanMax Katzaa hrefuser6000spanspanGameli Adzahoaa hrefuser671spanspanRachel Aronoffa This is what ive been thinking and will meet with a hrefuser3spanspanThomas Landraina a hrefuser1spanspanLeo Blondela a hrefuser5spanspanMarc Santolinia about on our potential addition of a peer review module to let users host their own democratic peer review processes I think you are right in a mix of random and selected project allocation but also ensuring we reduce bias by not allowing people to select the projects they d like to review somehow Resharing a message from a hrefuser7056spanspanVyshakh Rajachandran a Hello Everyone We are really excited to host Dr Sarah Wettstadt Director of MicroComms as our speaker in the first chapter of BioBattalion Webinar Series on 29th July 2021 3PM IST Please register for more information We would love to see you all on 29th See you later in the twice monthly Global Community CallGCC in 3hrs 6pm CET July 28th Today Find us in our zoom here if youd like to attend this is especially good for new members to find out a little about projects see what weve been up to or discuss ideas Looking forward to it Best wishes Chris Hey guys if youre new the Global Community call is a good place to orient yourself We hold them twice monthly Everyone is welcome Its in in 3hrs 6pm CET July 28th Today Find us in our zoom here if youd like to attend this is especially good for new members to find out a little about projects see what weve been up to or discuss ideas Looking forward to it Best wishes Chris hi a hrefuser6650spanspanMax Katza this is the app we want to make to combat AMR in africa for this project a hrefproject678spanspanImproving AMR surveillance in Africa onlinea a hrefuser622spanspanHarry Akligoha did you get in touch perhaps volunteers can help our developers can you still help a hrefuser5818spanspanJames Butlera we managed to get funding for developers for Harry and are going to use the app to make a big AMR map that hopefully will give us a picture of AMRs spread and teach new communities Thanks Sophie Is there a github Do you need anything to progress volunteers perhaps a hrefuser5974spanspanPaige PerillatPiratoineaa hrefuser191spanspanJust One Giant Laba really like these figures just came and saw this Hey how is it going is there anything we can do to help sending volunteers to help for example It will be nice to celebrate quite some incredible acheivements saw the link and its intensely cool a hrefproject216spanspanGlobal Free Webinars for Students a is this something you have knowledge in perhaps try contacting james butler here Helpful Engineering help especially in software could be brilliant just wondering if you think youd benefit from volunteers for example to help out with coding a hrefuser5974spanspanPaige PerillatPiratoinea do you think OSCMS would be interested or this could be on the list for new volunteers a hrefproject130spanspanContributions des Makers aux Hpitaux et Soignantsa Im not entirely sure Rachel if I can help however if Lypholisation involves only a freeze drying step perhaps Im wrong we have two freeze driers that we change parts and dont use constantly and Id love to help out We could send our address and fit quite a large volume On advise we normally are wary of sample splurting everywhere so its more the atm to vaccuum time that matters most Could our lab help at all BW liquid nitrogen at our university is communal and we handle often for the freezing prevacuum for when theyre opened are they already room temperature When we open freeze dried chemicals we tend to leave to reach room temperature before opening to prevent moisture being pulled incondensing on the cold material a hrefuser677spanspanSarah Warea do you have any resources or ideas as you are a science communicator of course is there a time limit on how long the applet is up a hrefuser5974spanspanPaige PerillatPiratoineaa hrefuser6650spanspanMax Katzaa hrefuser150spanspanMarianna Limasaa hrefuser3spanspanThomas Landraina We better share this excited for the tutorial videos i heard about too if you have anything else to say and other comments on peer review say it here and then the team can see too Thanks ill share definitely If youd like to add any slides please do here,Hi all We have our twice a month for new teams members or projects to join in and find a place to discuss current issues etc If youd like to add any slides please do here this makes it easier to present gtgtgtIn relation to this our next GCC will instead be a Project Focus we are looking for a project to promote and invite guests to check out and share So if youre

if you have any ideas nice hope it was good Here is our calendar invite for all these meetings,Dear everyone We are inviting you to attend our module in AMR we attach links for the first online MOOC Microbiology and bacteriology 101 and emergence of AMR in the environment This 1 and a half hour talk by Professor KS Saba and Chris LB Graham is on the basic biology behind antimicrobial resistance through to its study within the environment in Ghana The MOOC will be held at 10am12pm GMT Tuesday 21st September at this Zoom link The slides are currently available here where the mooc recording will also be kept for asynchronous learning We look forward to your attendance See you soon Dear all as part of the AMR Education project from this tuesday we are starting our training The MOOC will be held at 10am12pm GMT Tuesday 21st September at this Zoom link The slides are currently available here where the mooc recording will also be kept for asynchronous learning For any further information please use our AMR education project where all updates lectures and recordings will be held See you soon and meet us there Also feel free to update this space with any of your own learnings Hi followers I thought to share Kaaya mukasas request for information regarding free bioinformatics workshops and NGS workshops Hi all please ask any questions in this feed Hi All I present to you the first lecture in Video form If you didnt get a chance to attend or want to rewatch parts this is the link Hi All here is the recording of our first MOOC Microbiology and bacteriology 101 and emergence of AMR in the environment this and the answers to questions on the mooc will be available at the project MOOC 1 Dear all here is the recording of the second MOOC Techniques involved in the identification of microbes bacteria and viruses by Dr Linda Salekwa If you have any questions feel free to comment here or find out more on the mooc where the slides are available here Thanks Barbara sorry about the bot we are sorting these issues Hi I actually think you might find epidemium quite interesting as its a networking session and there may be attendants able to help you its full of bioinformaticians and data scientists a hrefuser5974spanspanPaige PerillatPiratoinea here personally found a hrefuser7156spanspanCourage Sabaa his work on tetracycline resistance of meat salmonella in Ghana extremely enlightening and further to this the modified Amoxicillin resistance horrifying Beautiful a hrefuser191spanspanJust One Giant Laba a hrefuser150spanspanMarianna Limasa,Hi Everyone thanks for coming to our third MOOC Laboratory setup DIY techniques quality control and AMR screening I attach our recording here If you have any questions feel free to ask the slides are available here Had a bit of a dilemma justifying to myself a trip by plane somewhere 365kg of CO2 rather than by train However its impossible by train in reality Justified this by suggesting its 38lb or 17kg CO2 sequestered by a tree in youth per year therefore if you can let 20 little trees grow and then either be replaced by other trees from then on or continue then the CO2 net is 0 But how do we literally offset this area and keep it like this and how much would it cost Ive seen offsets of 6 for this C02 but this is almost impossible if 160 trees are in each hectare depending on the land then for 20 trees ill need to guard this 0125 hectare area and buy it forever locked into the planet if we take the land trust which itself is a little colonial but at least gives this option thats 115 Does anyone have any good lectures or ideas on this dilemma and its issues Can you justify air travel with an offset like this Found this post on the target 2035 very interesting and perhaps their lecture is worth attending This is the kind of initiative needed for fighting AMR aswell as cancer Hi A little informal invitation to you all but if youd like to come to our global community call tomorrow youd be very welcome Its the first of our renewed quite impromptu monthly 1pm CET Asian Australasian and European Global community calls especially to see those we havent seen in some time

everyone for coming great call that we will put on youtube later,Dear All We would like to inform you the reviews have been received and calculated and acceptance of the grant made by the winning project Thank you also for taking part as a reviewer in the round and making the process possible The results quantitatively as perceived by your fellow applicants were the following with Feasibility and Impact questions mapped The results were close among projects with only one winner this time however the quality was remarkable and we hope you use the proposals created to apply for future grants and will keep you updated with any related we host or hosted by our partners The winning project and thus the project to receive funding is project 871 whom we have contacted to arrange funds accessible here,We should have a hackathon perhaps to get some projects going Thanks Rachel Im hoping so too soon a hrefuser5751spanspanShrestha Ratha,Great Can we share these events on other media,,Hi everyone Im looking for someone working in either AMR or diagnostics from Estonia Ireland Italy Lithuania Moldova The Netherlands Norway Spain or Sweden does anyone have any contacts Probably worth mentioning we now have a Call for proposals ability to organise a peer review or grant review Excited to use it when theres funding available In addition we have our BioRxiv prepaper here discussing how JOGL performed our first sets of Community review This will be submitted to a journal when absolutely finalised by us all Ill be talking a bit about this in the JOGS and inviting a few guests to talk about peer review and grant selection Hi Vittorio the network isnt about research its about how to develop research so your expertise are actually very suitable Could I email you a proposal Hi Is it right you work in AMR Im looking for a collaborator in Italy whom might be able to advise on calls about open science diagnostics and amr and thought you might be a suitable partner We would run an inter competition for travel funding and workshop funding for various aspects of it Do you think youd be interested itd be to add your name to a list of partners we would invite to the network potential grant awardees a hrefuser480spanspanvittorio milonea Haha I only saw it once but the platform is quite complex fantastic,Hi I just wanted to share my proposal for EuroBio joining an AMR initiative and potentially applying for travel or workshop funding Best wishes Hi I thought we should release our paper we managed to achieve from this project currently a preprint until we have the publication costs It was a pleasure to work with such a fantastic team and be part of the initiative which led to the work achieved in the call tonight Hi All theres a great What if session today at 630pm CET with Olaken and we have also just released our preprint on the initiative and our outputs Hopefully this will let us replicate our goals on a larger scale Share the paper and our values hopefully more funds will be created like this Hi All theres a great What if session today at 630pm CET with Olaken and we have also just released our preprint on the initiative and our outputs Hopefully this will let us replicate our goals on a larger scale Share the paper and our values hopefully more funds will be created like this join the what if event hosted by the winning project

kind of interesting a hrefuser5901spanspanHelosa Oss Bolla,a hrefuser191spanspanJust One Giant Laba Just saying Hi to everyone who follows JOGL in the feed noticed lots of activity would be nice to have automatic translations here for some of the recent Indonesian teams a hrefuser7115spanspaniGEM UnBEmbrapa Teamaa hrefuser7082spanspanCNPEMBrazil Teama a hrefuser671spanspanRachel Aronoffa I keep thinking about how to build a culture here so I can quit twitter the indonesian teams have been very acive here recently check out appjogliofeed also how we can make it easier to find people etc Check out the latest stuff So good Good luck The CEO of JOGL actually used to work in RNA funnily enough wow really impressive Have you got funding for this Nice,I hope you find a lab to do it in,Hi All excited to see the friendly faces virtually as well as in real life Check out our own story JOGLs story in our about through the news articles and in our two recent preprint and in review science publications Our community review technique during COVID19 and against antimicrobrial resistance How can we make IP more fair and also fund more projects in Desci Sharing this post congrats are you going to record this data anywhere,,Just discovered the Lili lab is incorporating 3D printing into baking Wow wow we actually have a 3D printer in my lab now Ive been thinking of using it Is TinkerCAD where you can get a tutorial for a lot of 3d printing designs also ps I just discovered your labs Praline recipe here That is literally the cutest use of 3D printing Ive ever seen Thanks to above,Have been having fun purifying PETaseMHETase with a hrefuser8050spanspanJK Chana I have some more interesting results share soon its a difficult protein to purify,,,a hrefproject121spanspanHelpful Engineeringa,Wanted to share a beautiful image i took on the microscope the other day some bacillus during sporulation With a lot of collaboration just published an awesome paper on how bacteria make their cell walls A lot of ligand docking substrate making and hypothesis Its interesting if you want to know how peptidoglycan is made Hi I was wondering where you are based Im asking for someone moving from Tokyo to UK and looking for a new lab space like this Wow is this related to Public Invention nice job red represents one sigma factor yellow another blue another etc etc a hrefuser3spanspanThomas Landrainaa hrefuser191spanspanJust One Giant Labaa hrefuser5spanspanMarc Santolinia,,,thanks funnily enough now im designing lipid architectures with stls
104,,,,,,Hi gijs1973 I was a little sick last week Hope you are well With respect to your question Cant we generate like values using lets say an expectation maximization method from the existing data and use these values Also Let me know how you want the data cleaned I will work on it ASAP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,,Nice Maybe you should improve the collaborative part It seems difficult to manage a big project with only news feed amp document sharing Simple link to Slack Trello Github might be useful Julien amp Charles Maybe you should present more clearly the difference between projets amp groups,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,,,,,Created the project Needs to invite people now Heres my own Twitter advertiser list as provided by Twitter itself I didnt have time yet to figure out whether the same data is also provided inside the newTwitter Archive one can download I made you a coowner of the project so you should have all the permissions to do things here The PDF upload worked for me Not sure what I did differently if anything Ah thats great Does it fully overlap As in Are all the advertisers from the PDF in that js file too,,,,,a hrefuser335spanspanMad Balla and I have spent the last two days on improving our prototype web application a hrefuser335spanspanMad Balla has started to work to add the support for the prospective part of the study which will allow an ongoing collection of selfreported symptoms going forward in time their current updates are at I personally started to reimplement the data fetching for both the Oura Ring and Fitbit to have those sources directly in the Quantified Flu app The work took me most of the day and its basically reproducing the work of the existing Open Humans data importer tools but we thought its necessary to have them right in the Quantified Flu app to minimize the amount of work we make new users jump through at signup By having the FitbitOura signins right in QF we dont have to reroute the hopefully large number of newcomers The code updates for that one are at Neither updates have been deployed yet but well hope to get to a deployable version of all of this soon And were live Head to to see our first prototype version Hey folks at the Quantified Flu project we have launched our first prototype to collect data to use wearables to differentiate COVID19 from other infections So far supports Fitbit and Oura devices If you have one of those youre welcome to participate already Were looking for devs who can help us integrate the APIs of Google Fit and Garmin to support more folks with their devices Check out our needs at or get in touch at projquantifiedflu on the COVID19 Slack,Our first working version of the quick attestation generator is now ready See the demo at The instructions of how to get your own one are on GitHub Launched two COVID19 related projects on JOGL Quantified Flu a communitybased project to see how we can use wearable device data for predicting infections see And for those locked down in France theres the attestation generator to quickly get the required paperwork to go outside Thanks to a hrefuser2952spanspanLukasz Baldya this is basically done we are currently fighting the Apple Appstore guidelines to get the app online asap We have data available for anyone that might want to try creating and sharing visualizations and it now comes with a nice API to fetch that data thanks to a hrefuser335spanspanMad Balla If you create visualization code wed love to share with others we have a system for sharing notebooks for Python amp R And JS visualizations could be added to the site itself Theres two basic types of data 1 data around retrospective events and 2 data around ongoing symptom reports We would especially love visualizations for ongoing symptom reports Both of these are available in JSON and CSV formats We went with what we thought made sense so feedback on the formats is very welcome Instructions on getting the data are below Lists of all available data JSON is available to provide the paths for all public data retrospective events symptom reports The same public data is visible human readable at amp when you click through you can add json or csv to a URL to get associated data Example of data from retrospective event These are provided according to event ID eg for 1 and Example of data from ongoing symptom reports These are provided according to an individuals random identifier eg for 20383123 and Let me know if you get stopped with one of those As I havent been stopped by the police once during the lockdown Ive no firsthand experience D Maybe we could ask the Ministry of the Interior for help D,This is closed thanks to a hrefuser4540spanspanKarolina Alexiouas great work of getting Google Fit integrated Were well on track with the improvements for a hrefproject135spanspanQuantified Flua in line with our predictions we made for the micro grant We already deployed the public data API and thanks to a hrefuser4540spanspanKarolina Alexioua we just deployed the integration for Google Fit And another great update on how a hrefproject135spanspanQuantified Flua is evolving Thanks to the amazing work of a hrefuser2952spanspanLukasz Baldya we now have an app that allows exporting Heart Rate data from Apple Health into Open HumansQuantified Flu Which means that we can finally support Apple Watch as a device You can download the app at With that we can now cover a broad range of devices All Fitbit devices with heart rate sensors The Oura Ring All devices that deposit data into Google Fit most notably virtually all Android Wear smart watches thanks to the work by a hrefuser4540spanspanKarolina Alexioua And all devices that deposit data into Apple Health most notably the Apple Watch thanks to a hrefuser2952spanspanLukasz Baldya If youre a Garminuser We havent forgotten you a hrefuser4540spanspanKarolina Alexioua is currently working on getting that support implemented Around 130 But we havent done any big advertisements as were waiting for the apple watch integration to deployed on the appstore,Thanks to another great update by a hrefuser4540spanspanKarolina Alexioua we now also support all Garmin wearables in Quantified Flu Check it out at With this we have fully implemented all the items that were part of the microgrant work Off to the next items a hrefuser1spanspanLeo Blondela unfortunately not But it looks like some suunto models have Google Fit support cf Ah thats too bad Do you know if they have an API in general Well the web service could be enough,Hey a hrefproject135spanspanQuantified Flua folks We want to invite you to join our Quantified Flu community call next week on Tuesday July 21 at 10am PDT 7pm CEST You can find the details and agenda at We also invite you to add your own items to the agenda What have you learned by using Quantified Flu What features would you like to see Looking forward to seeing many of you next week a hrefuser335spanspanMad Balla amp Bastian,Check out the latest little project that a hrefuser5spanspanMarc Santolinia and Ive been working on a hrefproject372spanspanCovid Symptoms Twitter Analysisa We aim to create a model of how tweets about selfreported COVID19 symptoms can help predict upcoming pandemic waves and more generally the rise and fall of the disease To that end we crawled public tweets from the Paris region filtered by symptoms keywords and plotted them in time However this filtering is very crude eg people dont only tweet about symptoms when they are currently falling sick but also about that one time a year ago when they fell sick or when talking about the general news To filter out such falsepositives we need your help Which of these tweets are describing an acute symptom and which ones dont Your contribution will make a direct impact And do you want to run your own data analyses You can download the current labeling including a UUID referring to each annotator session to create your own filtering or machine learning algorithm,,,,,,Please contribute to our crowdfunding campaign to make this study happen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,,Miaou,,,,,,,,,Hello Im Antony a pharmacy student and game designer How can I help you on this project Whats your need Whats your objectives and how you want the game to convey this objectives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,,It definitely misses some research bar by SDG or name or keyword All the parts are not really Responsive to mobile shape Eg the comments part automatically update When you comment someone else but the add comment does not appear we have to relaunch the page for Adding a system of badges like they use on StackOverFlow would really improve they way you see people on the website Miaou back There is usually solution to add sso with social network on the Web framework Choice is still up to everyone You could even imagine badges for the project like hot topic big community 50 solved Would be some achievement to push people to go further,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,,,,,,,,,,Any ideas on how to safely test to confirm whether a particular design accurately detects the virus Or are there collaborators we can work with to run the tests themselves I do see control plasmids available for sale from commercial entities such as IDT specific to the purpose of testing Covid19 which might be exactly the thing we need on this Would be good to get confirmation from an expert whether this is the right target to design towards Other commercial site for Covid19 control plasmids Super helpful tipsinfo from protocol referenced is on About page of this project The Cas13based method developed by Sherlock is super easy I think they are frantically scaling it up for distribution See attached protocol Covid19 has an RNA genome so any DNAbased test starts with reverse transcriptase And any lab using surrogate RNA to develop and evaluate the test would have to be able to work RNAsefree Useful link To the collaborators on the project Ive been adding all of us to a email group to grant edit permissions to the Google Doc Please message me if youd like to be added to the list to begin contributing there Also what are everyones preferences on communication mediums We can use that email list message things directly on JOGL or find some other alternatives I also have a Zoom account we can use for holding group calls together to get some high level planning going and coordinateorganize how to focus our efforts Thanks everyone whos been joining to help out on this work I imagine and might be able to help intermittently at SoundBio will let them confirm or deny though lol To Toms point about environmental testing Btw Ive set up a Slack team to help with more frequent communications across the team Join via this link Hey all Thanks so much for joining us on this mission to take collective action towards developing more accessible diagnostics for the Covid19 virus Theres a lot of hard work ahead of us but I look forward to helping this awesome group of people make an impact Were building this plane as we fly it but I want to make sure everyone has completed a few main onboarding tasks as we get fully up and running well create a dedicated doc for new members to see all onboarding steps in a central maintained location 1 Join the project on JOGL 2 Fill out this Google Form to help us understand who is supporting the project why youre interested and what backgroundsskillsexpertiseresources you bring to the table 3 Join the Slack team Our next call will be Wednesday March 11th at 6pm GMT1 CET Paris time Join us then on Zoom Awesome to hear do you know if the sequence or key subsets of it are available to view somewhere That would help with iterating on designs Sweet thanks Yeah Ill be able to help run some tests at SoundBio myself as well as will ask around among our local community for more volunteers to help with the process Do we have the sequence available somewhere and annotations to note which pieces are both worthwhile genetic targets that also wouldnt post a risk to send out many copies of to other labs for helping with testing I went ahead earlier today just to nab the URL lol and created a slack if we want to go that route joglcovid19 Awesome looking forward to the call Thanks for organizing Theres some uncertainty around the strain split idea Rob Carlson has a thread about the nuances on twitter Hey Adeline I just updated the About section for this project on JOGL Be sure to request to join the Google Drive permissions group then you should be able to open the main Open Lab Notebook where a lot of these links and stuff are being gathered were also imminently going to restructure the organization of the Google Drive so some of the content for specifics of reagentsetc for each method likely will make their way into other Google Docs that are linked to from the main doc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

218,,,,,Hi This is a good topic and I would like to introduce myself briefly here I am interested in the concept of harmonisation of data and the ingestion of different data sources but for now I will follow the project closely and can comment on shared content My specialisation is on data visualisation and handling of geographical information Please dont hesitate to reach out if you feel my input could be usefulhelpful in the course of the project duration Best Gijs One way of bringing all the data together to Harmonize Vaccination is to build a Spatial Data Infrastructure happy to help to set this up if this one of the solutions you are thinking about using in this challenge,Hi All A quick update on the progress of this project What did we do We collected data from several open data deposits Created a method to calculate and visualise the country risk score What is next Cleaning the data Calculating the index Combining the indices to a grouped score Calculating the country score with the grouped scores Outlook a web interface where visitors can see the global risk for vaccination and by selecting a country the composite of the score This is in short what we have been up to and I hope that can tell more in the next weeks about our progress with the tasks Your suggestions remarks feedback and questions are more than welcome to improve the project Cheers Gijs Hi All Please find the GitHub repository here Cheers Gijs Hi All It always takes a bit of time to design a process to clean and reformat the data you are planning to use in a project suggestions are always welcome The process I am going to follow will look like this 1 Find the correct ISO3 country code for each row in the data 2 Use only the rows in the data which match the country list 3 Mark the rows with no data and calculate basic statistics for the other rows 4 Create a fuzzy function over the min and max values 5 Apply the function so that there is a fuzziness between 0 and 1 6 Assign a default value either close to 0 or 1 to the rows with no data I hope to process a few datasets over the next days to test this process Cheers Gijs Im using an opensource world map to later visualise the country scores Hi All The first phase of this little project is over which I have treated as a Proof of Concept PoC and it looks like that with the help of experts and a bit more of work the method could be used on a larger scale I will use the documentation to explain this in a bit more detail and I hope we can work on this in the next phase The attached EXCEL file FuzzyCalv1xlsx contains the processed data I processed so far important tabs are SheetList listing all the sheets in the file WorldCountryList combining all data to the country Export the cleaned list to be joined to the map RiskScoring the risk calculations based on three aspects The other EXCEL file is an example of how the raw data is fuzzified to an interval 01 the tab Functions show the fuzzy relationship used in this process all other datasets have followed the same process Next is a little python coding to create a Jupyter Notebook to bind the Export Sheet to a dynamic map and create the triangle on the fly As always questions and comments are more than welcome Cheers Gijs Ps If I would create a Jupyter Notebook how can I make the Notebook available through the git repository Hi thanks it is an exciting project and wouldnt mind the help with the cleaning of the data The data collection is 16 files so thats not too bad and I can place what we have in one zip file on the project page Happy to discuss with anyone interesting in helping us on how to go from here the data is not standardised and while some are coming from the same source each file has unique problems marc I like your suggestion of replacing values and this is indeed a known method to get an approximation of the most likely missing value We could try to apply it on this data but I think that the dataset we are using is not large enough We only have countrylevel data so that means around 220 values at maximum To give an example Current account balanceas an index for the economic situation in a country has 73 missing values of the 264 rows An additional complication with this data is that the rows are not always referring to a country but regions are listed as well Working on missing data and data cleansing could be an essential topic to discuss in a larger group or just here in the comments or at another location on the platform I am open for suggestions no problem I will try to explain in a few words what Fuzzy Logic is and how why I try to apply it here The method has been developed by Lotfi Zadeh 1965 to make decisions based on imprecise and nonnumerical information The first step when applying fuzzy logic is the fuzzification of the data to create a membership function which converts the original data to an interval 01 When the new value is 0 then the value has no relationship to the set and if the new value is 1 then there is a very strong relationship In this particular case I want to describe the relationship a parameter has to vaccination risk Thus when there is a strong relationship with the risk that you might not receive the right medical aid in a country because there are not enough medical workers this country will receive a value close to 1 and reverse when there is a very good medical service with many medical workers per capita the value drops near to zero So when we do this for all the parameters in the assessment we can equally rate them or use an expert to rate and the use this input in a multicriteria analysis This is very brief and short I could do a short lecture on this topic if there is interest for a broader explanation there is a little personal project attached to this which I would like to test here as well I hope the theory works because then I just can drop a docker kindoflink on the platform the Notebook will be executed elsewhere and only the graphics are visible through the link However it would be good to have one way of working on the JOGL platform so I am more than happy to follow what is agreed,Hi All I started the documentation and I have placed a draft version of the form in the documentation section of the project page I will keep updating this file over the coming days and replacing it with the latest information To start I have filled the lower part of the form out already and the other sections I hope to fill with the text from this page and your feedback So as always questions and comments are more than welcome Cheers Gijs Interesting article with some telling observations its never black and white Perhaps CoImmune could do something here I agree a bit more context would be helpful there are many solutions and the best approach imho would be to attach the website to an existing platform as a new pageservice so people will find you quicker instead of building something up from scratch Happy to stay in the loop and comment on your developments Gijs Hi Are you trying to geolocate the twits orconcentrating on the NLP of the task only and which modules are you thinking about to deal with multiple languages using tweeter to communicate about vaccination Sorry only catching up now with your project in this challenge G Please find the short introduction to this project here the linked video is just under four minutes 357 but too heavy to post here I also placed a few extra slides in the Documents section so you can go through the slides of the video at your own pace Hope to see you all in the next phase Gijs Another thought It seems that there are at least three projects which are touching on the same topic like the Data exploration of existing DB and Global Vaccination Risk Assessment projects Perhaps it would be a good idea if projects within the same space are meeting in January to see where they overlap and share their experienceof the first phase I will repost this message op the page of the other project as well Happy to discuss Gijs Hi not sure if I can attend the meeting but a thought came to mind while working with theform and filling out the documentation wouldnt it be more efficient to add this form to the project page as a separate section So that everyone can see the information produced without downloading and uploading the file participation and joined efforts might be more natural in this way as well Thanks The data is available in a GitHub repository but we didnt add the documentation or listed the sources we are working on this this will be one of the actions in Phase 2 if there is enough interest in a productweb service like this Perhaps this also answers your concern about the visibility of the project finding a landing place and finding the audience is planned early in Phase 2 as one of the first things after a Go decision The main idea behind the tool is that users can add their own data to the system either more global dataor regional dataas long as the sources added are matching the boundaries So for now the tool is set up for country level data only one row of data for each country and when a data element is missing either the value is set manually to the maximum minimum or average value of the dataset this is one of those expert decisions and the choice will be recorded ideally you want data for all rows in the dataset Hope this clarifies some things and more than happy to chat more about this tool on and offline Gijs Related article Will do Interesting session I will try to make the project as open as I can Not sure where I could share this so using this post In the meeting there was uncertainty about using Git and GitHub perhaps this video will help Thanks I have not looked into the updates please be aware that geolocation is very dependent on the settings of the user and the service The results should be aggregated to low resolution before further analysis This might not be a issue for the problem you are trying to solve but something to keep in mind I think focusing on multilingual analysis of the tweets will be more beneficial Happy to discuss more offline or here Cheers Gijs,I thought I would share this here Note Googles new dataset search tool was publicly released on January 23rd 2020 Google recently released dataset search a free tool for searching 25 million publicly available datasets It is on my todo list to look into this in a bit more detail because I have at the moment no idea what kind of structure is in place or if there is even a structure behind the service I hope that there is at least some metadata at the highest level so you could construct a shell over the search engine and standardise in an organisation the search to have more consistency in the search results if you would wish this Searches are very personal and some people are natural searchers retrieving useful information fast while others are less efficient in their searches If I find something useful I will share it shall I just comment under here or do you have a better place in mind where I could postshare the information,OK I had a little bit more time to think and do some research There is a good read here Concluding with A search tool like this one is only as good as the metadata that data publishers are willing to provide We hope to see many of you use the open standards to describe your data enabling our users to find the data that they are looking for which I completely subscribe to and made me think of a standard search tool or guidelines and I think that there is no general onesolutionfitsall approach possible I also looked at the documentation and found the link Datasets in the Google Cloud are stored as A body of structured information describing some topics of interest but I have the strong suspicion that not all the fields listed in the schema are filled which makes the standardisation of search protocols an exercise with a low RoI in my opinion But there is value in exploring the google dataset storage because there are required properties and one of them is the distributioncontentUrl which means that all datasets in the google cloud can be saved as a local copy and used in research if the rights allow this another required property I am not sure what I can do next and would like to discuss this in a broader group,I saw this post and perhaps it is an idea if we as a community want to reach out to a broader audience In a GIF Deploy a coronavirus website in 45 seconds More than happy to start a thread about this somewhere if others think this is a good idea Hi Stephane You must have seen this but in case you missed it Cheers Gijs,,,,Following the group and will join any discussion within my range of experience groundwater surface water

252,,,,,,Finally we have our backend code Backend code HERA Mobile App code,Hello So I am not an expert by all means but I have had a chance to work on some similar things in my previous job and also education I would be open to have a chat about it if you wish to at least give you some idea on how that works in couple different countries and where to look for some guidelines Best Approach You guys have a solid problem statement and methodology that directly address the issue Did you consider also incorporating google trends At least change in trends around the time of outbreaks or when there is an important tweet etc Implementation I think this would be invaluable if scaled up to an automated algorithm like a real time analysis that can extend to prediction for future etc I do not know the technical knowhow but there are good models that predict the outbreaks and maybe they can be associated with the social media outcomes Impact This has great potential impact for the future as this issue is nowhere near being gone Hesitancy and general health behavior is highly related to culture and norms of that population Should you decide to extend the analysis to other global communities a suggestion would be to definitely implement social science protocols to understand why and how of peoples behavior This work is definitely needed and you are doing a great thing Hey This is a great project btw So I have couple suggestions that might be useful I realized working with DHS of countries they do not use the same statistical plan For example For Turkey you can not find timely vaccination they are aggregated that might cause showing the vaccination coverage is higher than it acctually is And they use that data to provide to WHO So this is a small example that might confound things One should always be careful with the politics involved when aggregating country data I know it is very very detailed thing that might be overseen just wanted to let you know It is also important to realize that different countries use different vaccines That actually vary a lot in efficacy and effectiveness A future plan could be controlling the coverage with actual results of illness or u5m Again this is not vital for your project at the moment but would be very useful in translating to health data Hope it helps Again great solution to an ongoing vital problem HERE is our video of HERA description Our first take of an explainer video for users One feedback we got from our research was many people found it hard to input data and understand how to use it We are working on a simpler ux design but in the meantime we though it makes sense to prep an explainer video So here is take one Let us know what you think Thanks Will do Thanks Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

280,,,,,I joined I cant add documents so I defined a Need and attached a file I guess I could have commented here as well with an attachment For me it is at but there is some weirdness I sometimes get that I am in 1000 audiences and 0 advertiser and when this is the case I cant download Then it changes and reflects more accurate counts and I can download then If this is indeed a EUonly availability issue that would be very interesting To be able to write this or suggest stuff for it I need to better understand the data pipeline from a technical standpoint and what these termsconsent are supposed to cover Lets say we start with the Twitter archive The first step would be to go get a series of strings in the file called personalizationjs Do the termsconsent have to cover what happens after the filtering or the whole input This is really interesting The combination of bottom up data on what European institutions do and the thorough Freedom of Informationing that could come their way would open very interesting avenues of inquiry Now its different in the Documents section Presumably this is tied to permissions So I downloaded my Twitter Archive There is a file in there called personalizationjs That file contains an entry called audienceAndAdvertisers which has an overlap with the first half of the PDF That would obviously be easier to use Not quite Looks like around 80 overlap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

361,,,,,,,,,,Anyone with access to 3D printers You can literally print masks following this procedure It needs about 50 grams of filament not PLA better use TPU or TPE for printing 41 grams for the mask 3 grams for the middle part and 6 grams for the cap which costs around 4 euros depends on the country actually if you order one from the big chinese eshops maybe its cheaper per unit but it takes time to deliver When it is printed it needs about 2 hours you can use a round filter like a piece of surgical mask with 37 cm diameter A typical surgical mask is about 175 x 95 cm so you can get around 8 pieces 2 x 4 which are placed one by one in the mask Be careful so the filter is the right size and no air goes around After every use throw away the used filter and wash the mask with disinfectant wipe clean in order to be safe for latter use If your area is low in mask supply you can use make up pads which normally are not in high demand I hope this helps May the force be with you and sorry for my English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

454,,,,,,,Hey Gijs and Shibu Your PoC idea is solid however at its current state it seems inaccessible to a nonexpert public I think a good step would be to identify your target audience for a quick prototype without including user data yet Be careful with the use of the word risk in a statistical vs common langage I recommend making the sources of your initial data known Can this approach be scaled up to any type of vaccine and how do you deal with sparse data in specific countries Its a great idea to have an website accessible to all to assess these disease risks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
456,,,,,,,Hi team Harmonize Vaccination Your project seems very impressive We see in the How to contribute section that this project is finished already I think the project we are currently working on could be one of the users of your platform system We were thus wondering if and how our gamecould maybe make use of the API you developed to access the vaccination data in order to present it during the training of the health workers our game is addressed to Thank you Hi Philippe and the team I was going through the data you have published here and was wondering are you considering for this app and does it even exist a way to validate if participants in the poll actually do what they state they did I am thinking of the Bradley effect in voting behavior and whether something similar may happen in vaccination polls since people might know that there is a right answer expected from them We would really appreciate that thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
459,,,,,,,Im a member of the HEROIC sant team project We developed a short questionnaireusing engagement approaches from the human and social sciences to engage healthcare professionals and users not only to be vaccinated against the flu but also to promote flu vaccination Excellent idea to detect vaccine hesitancy in social media patient data Have you planned a semantic analysis and or an analysis of the keywords evoking vaccine hesitation This could be very interesting in the context of the development of our project Best Regards Hi Mihaela his is a question we asked ourselves and this is why we asked the respondents if they agreed to be recalled at the end of the vaccination campaign ie in March 2020 to assess whether they have implemented their commitment to get vaccinated but also to show off or even promote vaccination Best Regards Philippe Im a member of the HEROIC sante team project on vaccination hesitancy We developed a short questionnaireusing engagement approaches from the human and social sciences to engage healthcare professionals and users not only to be vaccinated against the flu but also to promote flu vaccination Im sure that we can use what we have learned about our current experimentation to probably give you some feedbacks and insight to build your videogame Do not hesitate to contact me Best Regards Philippe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those of you who arent in our Slack workspace or missed the announcement Our third AllCommunity Call is tomorrow 318 at 6 PM Paris Time we will be using this zoom link Well be sharing the agenda tomorrow and in the Zoom room but main points of discussion will be about the new JOGL programchallenge pages slack amp drive organization identifying challengeworkgroup leads and currentnew project ideas and it will all be recorded if you arent able to make it We also have a few workgroup calls through the rest of this week so check the Slack for the times for those Hope to see you all on the call Hello Everyone Thanks so much for joining us for our third allcommunity call Weve grown quite a bit and its great to see some new faces each week If you didnt get a chance to be on the call here are the notes from it and the recording There are some important logistics so Id recommend skimming through the agenda if you have the chance Wanted to quickly summarize a few of the important points 1 Our Program Page is now live this page If youre working on a project itd be amazing if you could create a channel dedicated to it with the projxx naming convention and consider listing it on JOGL under the program for more visibility amongst the community To create a channel just select the icon next to Channels To see all the channels just click the word Channels 2 Regardless of if youve got a project on JOGL our Slack workspace or in your own labinstitution please fill out this form to quickly summarize your project Wed like to make it easily visible to the community at large the amazing work groups part of this initiative are doing 3 If you havent gotten the chance to please read over the Onboarding Doc bitlyopencovid19onboarding Its still under construction but it has important

want to become a member of the advisory board or know someone who wants to please complete this form We will be having weekly allcommunity calls every Wednesday 6PM CET to update the entire community on progress hope to see you there Thank you to everyone who has contributed This is interesting infoyou should definitely share this idea with the detection group on our Slack This is awesome Itd be amazing if you could share the results with the detection team on Slack when you get them This method definitely seems fascinating and could possibly be something we look more into Do you mind sharing it with the detection group on Slack so more people can leave feedbackshare ideas on it,Hello all just a reminder that well be having our Sixth Global Community Call this Wednesday at 6PM CET The prgmcommunicationsteam has developed a set of Google slides that we would like projects to fill out If you have something that you want to share during the Wednesday global community calls please

you on Zoom If youre unable to make the call this week check the Resources tab on this page to find the playlist link of all of our calls,,,,,Hello Everyone Congrats to all the projects that recently applied for XPrize We wish you all the best and cant wait to hear whats in store for you The summer has flown by and its been nearly six months since the OpenCovid19 Initiative was launchedwhether youve just joined or youve been part of the community for months wed love to hear updates from you and your projects at our next Global Community Call We hope youll join us on Zoom on Wednesday 916 4PM UTC Zoom Link Hey BioFolks We are organizing a special OpenCOVID19 JOGL session at the Global Community Biosummit on the 11th of October where biorelated COVID19 projects taking place within the JOGL community can present their work and be celebrated in front of an international audienceWe have a 90min slot so we can accommodate several of you The Global Community Biosummit is going to be online this year and if you dont happen to know the Biosummit already it is an amazing event to join and present your work in front of a beautiful community of doers and grassroots biologists If you want to be part of the JOGL session please put your name on this document with your name and the project youd like to present Any active OpenCovid19 Project can ask to join the session but we would

660,,,,,,,,,,First post on JOGL This WHO page has got a good set of links to all the detection protocols put forward by health departments some structures appearing posted yesterday it looks like Also a good collection of related resources and groups here Open invitation to collaborate on recreating comparative analysis paper Might not need to wait for sequences of new antibodies as some papers I think are saying theyre predicting and showing SARSCoV reagents can be utilized to characterize SARSCoV2 infection Muhammad Ismail remember than you are taking a risk if using CL2 This requires CL3 In fact it could result in you aerosolising it with in your lab and result in the infection of many people I dont want to put you off but you should understand the risks if you didnt already Yeah that is concerning and I dont know confusing Did Is it that their kit is not working or that they dont have class 3 containment facilities or something else I notice Alabama is now operational but the other 5 still are not yet Great to hear from you Christopher Yes it will be a problem caused by COVID19 We need people who know how a ventilator works and who can make versions for use in an emergency if theres no available capacity in their local hospital this is really useful information Ive copied it into the doc on ventilators Are you a respiratory consultant registrar I have a lot more questions so if you were keen to answer them we could set up a call Thanks for the rapid reply Theres products like this out there That no good It would be good to have a respiratory reg ICU consultant to comment on this kind of thing Ill see if I can find someone I notice there was a Dr John Campbell Can you reach out to him to see if he knows anyone please I dont know how I make you an admin Ive added it to the project info though it does contain more info than just ventilators oxygen Awesome Thank you Hi that would be really useful Were blocked at the moment because its not clear that NIVs Non invasive ventilators would be useful From reading about the Italian experience though maybe it would be Yes please Charles at that address and myself please bioajpgmailcom 1 Weve seen the MIT design but I dont think its suitable for ARDS but in general looks like a good vent project,This is great a hrefuser101spanspanChristopher LB Grahama I see their doc is here And says 100 000 euros to distribute as microgrants of up to 3000 euros,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

663,,,,,,,,,,There is an interesting and obvious approach for sampling sputum Here the case of a monoclonal antibody against the SARS CoV spike that reacts with the SARS CoV2 spike But here a CryoEM structure of the spike with this comment SARSCoV RBDspecific monoclonal antibodies do not have appreciable binding to 2019nCoV S suggesting antibody crossreactivity may be limited between the two RBDs A second one is saliva Here an interesting example of a small ssDNA virus previously founddetected by within BronchoAlveolar Lavage BALnot possible for a simple sampling then detected in the mouth using oral swabs with a similar efficiency Maybe similar with SARSCoV2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
667,,,,,,,,,,Thats great news Ellen Just reading through the paper they call for 3 ul of RNA template but they collected that from samples using an extraction method Im not familiar with Did you use or plan to use not sure youve done yet a standard RNA miniprep Do expect this reaction to have sufficient sensitivity to use for environmental samples or are you planning on this for human samples,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
668,,,,,,,,,,The WHO has a list of molecular assays to diagnose SARSCoV2 from around the world including primers chosen by various national public health agencies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
671,,,,,,,,,,Hackuarium hopes to contribute with our BSL1 lab obviously not for patients samples however these two genes Orfa and N were used for the colorimetric LAMP work NEB and preprint from Zhang et al I thought these are openly available info not commercial entities no one plans to do anything foolish there are many ways to contribute without too many risks even positive controls can be synthesized serious planning of course is required from the colorimetric lamp protocol preprint for info here is what is normally done with patient samples Briefly respiratory specimens swabs collected from patients admitted to various Wuhan health care facilities were immediately placed into sterile tubes containing 3ml of viral transport media VTM The medium constitutes Hanks balanced salt solution at pH 74 containing BSA 1 amphotericin 15 gmL penicillin G 100 unitsmL and streptomycin 50 gmL The swabs were deactivated by heating at 56 C for 30 minutes in a biosafety level 2 BSL 2 laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Zhengdian Park Due to the possibility of generating aerosols the samples were allowed to cool at room temperature before further processing If the samples were not for use immediately they were stored at 4 C,excited to hear one of our partners already found one N set of primers seems much more sensitive than the others and this should be confirmed before we make our orders glad to have been here for the postman but he only had the bill not the package with enzymes due to arrive today For more info about the project see this doc from Guy our colleague who developed the GMO Detective There are some details that are a bit technical but dont be put off just ask especially to new members too thanks for your interest and see you in the slack projnucleicacidamplification,Results with the old school enzyme for this method are still looking very good see attached With reception of some FreeGenes toolkits at Hackuarium and also by other colleagues this makes having a more open science version of the CoronaDetective really seem possible weve had the first results with the mRNA control sets already and can soon start with the bit of virus being targeted initially yes we have needs for logistics and comms and data analyses and probably more please see the onboarding doc and join the slack clicking on the box in the graphic in github to give the real alignment is super,hi weve been doing more sequence gazing in terms of multiplex hopes while awaiting the latest order of primers even though in silico predictions might be a bit discouraging as in the attached pdf with complex interactions between sequences possible you always have to see how the target sets work empirically patience while the situation again seems to worsen in regards to corona internationally at least is not easy to give you a qualitative impression of what our amplification data can look like so lovely signals for all the tubes of the 8th round including saliva tests are shown an end point image of the raw data obtained to make such curves is also included in blackampwhite so good together looking forward to many more results soon from Guy in Paris too in the meantime always remember to take care and wear masks when distancing is not possible,one more step forward a first good multiplex result with the NMFam and RPHex primer sets We included some RNAsin in the master mix and let the Reverse Transcription go 10min at 55 degrees before going up to amplification temp 65 and it can be seen readily with the original GMO Detective detector Hey Liu Bov thanks for the note Yes the communication needs to expand more We are out there not just in the slack also the Hackuarium slack but its facebook too and I presented for the big academic collab group organised by Chris Mason yesterday For the lectures without borders I already discussed with Eugenia Covernton expressing my interest also for my genomic integrity projects and thought it was just a matter of time Great if you want to help join in to spread the word We are getting closer to having the our first sets of strip tubes put together by Guy in Paris a hrefuser101spanspanChristopher LB Grahama I think we meant to share more details from our teammates in Paris with you already too Of course publicity is welcome just be aware that we have more work ahead before our first tube strips will be sent to everyone for validation For anyone interested this was the prezi from yesterday hi again a hrefuser15spanspanLiu Bova yes thats it the one with a hrefuser4633spanspanEugenia Coverntona happy to contribute,XPrize possibilities heres the recorded event for your viewing,woah Corona Detective was chosen as one of 200 semifinalists who get to try out the unknown samples for XPrize Here is the short teaser trailer we made for the optional video for the application What do you think We included also the JOGL Live event recording for them and anyone who wants to learn more thx to Marianne L for the nice medium article,excited that Guy from the Corona Detective Team is moving forward from the Falling Walls Paris competition to the finals yoopiii looking forward to seeing his video I was very happy to present this project not only with the whole JOGL collaborative team for Biosummit on Sunday but also for my Colombian colleagues at Ms Arte Ms Accin on Tuesday and for the OpenHackuarium meeting last night It was extra cool that a hrefuser1556spanspanFrancisco Javier Quero Lombarderoa and Gustavo the former Hackuarium lab manager were able to join in for the presentation in Spanish too as my ubuntu zoom couldnt manage the translator buttons for some reason one thing windows 10 did better I will attach the flyer for the Colombian event here Additionally here is a link to our slide deck in Spanish just in case So glad for the collaborative research and open science JOGL push and hoping we might get a bit more support in our second request due tomorrow P On top of everything XPRIZE still awaiting sample feeling a bit too much like we are in the teaser vid this will make it easier for us to collect clinical validation data from colleagues testing CoronaDetective tubes after international shipments lt3 a hrefuser2126spanspanGuy Aidelberga also got to present in Spanish yesterday in Chile with Fernan Federicis group btw we got in our application and hope lots of people will participate in the open review process here is the review link you can help using the following form,sounds like the blinded proficiency set for XPRIZE is on its way to Guy in Paris thanks to everyone who wants to join the team We expect more activity in coming weeks esp looking into further validation GMP production possibilities and more You can join us via this Slack channel for now projnucleicacidamplification of the JOGL Open Covid19 Initiative and see more in the About section for a link to an onboarding doc Our colleagues in Sri Lanka are in the midst of their XPRIZE set and were glad to report that the tubes Guy sent them still worked well after their shipment at ambient temps and waiting for all these weeks Happily Guy got his results for a similar sample set in Paris already last week We think they look incredibly clear in terms of calling positivenegative samples as shown below To note and these are just the direct not concentrated in any way reactions The logistical challenge of getting off all the test samples was incredible and we congratulate the XPRIZE team for pulling it all together Even more we look forward to hearing how Corona Detective did Patience is a virtue yay thanks all JOGL reviewers a bit more support to CRI and Hackuarium with this high score review is really welcome lt3 Hi By the end of this week the Corona Detective results from Guy in Paris for the blinded proficiency set of samples for the XPRIZE semifinals will be submitted We think of this as a great opportunity for validation of the method and look forward to seeing how it all goes It is a long shot for getting to the finals however just 20 from over 200 teams will make it Whatever happens we will still be sending more tubes to colleagues for further validation particularly in a clinical setting thank you for the kind words pulling together these international collaborations with the support for open science by JOGL has been incredible We have more fun experiments ahead with the oligos for the triplex tests to be ordered very soon and more validation by clinical collabs,Happy winter solstice Remember to take care over the holiday season Even if you got vaccinated yesterday it is not ok to go out and party for new years Congratulations to our JOGL colleagues in Berkeley They will go on to the finals Our Corona Detectives direct results for the semifinals were indeed as good as we suspected with no false positives or crossreactivity with other pathogens in the unknown samples but simply not sensitive enough We finally got back our decoded unknown set run for the semifinals but still have not had confirmation as to whether the reactions ran by our colleagues in Sri Lanka on concentrated samples were also considered when they evaluated our results unfortunately A full analysis will come after we get it all together Nonetheless our push for more clinical validations and the triplex test is still happening and we are certainly still very glad to be part of this big open science collaboration with some of our quencher probes on their way to Berkeley from Paris already to help for their finals efforts Fingers crossed Getting more easy diagnostic tests out even as vaccinations are beginning is still necessary especially in resourcestrapped settings All the best as we come to the end of this crazy year CovidAlert the JOGL project is now called ViralAlert for the XPRIZE contest btw,should certainly be that we are almost ready to submit a short communication in fact thx for encouragement,We are excited that QC on the last tubes made in Paris looks great so soon our colleagues in Cameroon Ghana Chile and more will get some for further validation tests Guy can even add much more of the direct inactivated sample to Corona Detective reactions he found meaning we will increase sensitivity We are also in discussion with a professional lyophilizing company in the states wondering if we will get a huge standardized batch for ever further tests Keep taking care do it together,Its a day for great news Not only has Guy successfully defended his thesis bravo Dr Aidelberg but the BioRXiv preprint with Ali including the Influenza B multiplex will soon be submitted for peer review to the Journal of Clinical Microbiology With discussion on production strategies and more validation tests coming soon from colleagues maybe we can ultimately enable surveillance testing with Corona Detective More super news Fran gets to wrap up his Masters work started in Shenzhen at CRI with Guys advisor He and Guy will have at least a couple of overlapping months in Paris to work on the project hardware open enzymes and production of reaction tubes We are applying for more funding from JOGL Thank you for your kind consideration and support Project members who never really joined in slack or onboarded with the team otherwise wondering if you could become followers instead and please review our latest grant request Especially for further production runs and validation tests funding is essential Worried however if we remove you as a project member will you not be insulted Please therefore confirm your interest in helping us really by reviewing our submission for the 5th JOGL funding call our third time asking for support Thanks btw here was our presentation for the LAMP Community Labs Working group Also a video link might come soon looks like only RTPCR methods made it in the end outside one antigen test as the big winners still not discouraged however where are you and have you seen the production protocol,Were looking into doing Corona Detective workshops in Switzerland maybe during the fall school holidays late October including the diy fluor detector build as in the GMO Detective workshops fingers crossed also for open hardware exploration 5564degree incubations please write me if you saw this to say its ok or not dear inactive project members havent heard back from you but hope you are reviewing JOGL grants thanks to the project members and followers who responded fingers crossed for this round of funding,Glad that we not only got the funding here Thanks reviewers and JOGL but also have our Corona Detective manuscript officially in press Thanks team at the Journal of Biomolecular Techniques where it may come out side by side with the big glamp review more reason to get surveillance screening especially if vaccinations are slowing people without symptoms pass most infections of course a hrefuser2126spanspanGuy Aidelberga can you ask Ron about that please He is corresponding author Jan But is there a rush people can always get the protocolsio etc,The Corona Detective workshop was run in Bilbao Paris Zurich and Lausanne for the BBK Open Science Festival last night Part of a celebration of community biology during the incubation Roland D presented his bioart work and even played some guitar Thank goodness the only positives from the tests were positive control tubes More info can be found here input on the simple protocol also welcome,Happy to have more discussion going on with lyophilisation experts and hoping to sort out a selftesting format for Corona Detective Please see the Needs section here if you think you can help with design aspects Looking forward to the JOGL event on Wednesday and more collaborative open science The in press Corona Detective paper has been proofed and should come out at some point in JBT There is even a doi already Still impact and new variants do seem likely to decrease and increase respectively before pub Surveillance screening may still be the only way ahead particularly if vaccine coverage does not improve In some other good news at least a second video call with the at scale experts is scheduled Hoping the MM for the PoP batch will be easy to organise and we will end up with enough reactions to put to good use ie for regulators in Switzerland 300 tubes are basically the minimum needed Learning by doing master mix proof of principal Finally here is a shout out for JOGL Africa Looking forward to the event today We are looking for reproducible at scale production lots and lots of tubes well packaged A third site may not help now as our lyophilisations here and at CRI went very well Its cool to try though if you like protocol is available though the experts seem to have different sugar alts to try However keeping the reactants dry once the foil pack is opened even with sealed tubes is still problematic The design for a self test format is also still very up in the air Happy to hear ideas they are kept at room temperature actually should just stay sealed until used,,We have some news Clinical validation tests in Ghana and Chile are promising with no false positives and reliable detection on RNA samples already used for rtPCR down to about Ct25 However the latest tubes sent to Sri Lanka are still stuck at customs and their lockdown extended too Additionally we finally are looking forward to getting a proof of principal batch of reactions from a company that could really make them at scale for distribution EVIK in Canada Hopefully they will be able to do the production at a price point useful for the places most need of surveillance testing Here is a recent video they put out Looks good We hope to have real clinical validations on fresh samples for sidebyside Corona Detective and RTPCR comparisons with a big batch if all goes well but will require significant funding for that Let us know if you have ideas that might help please Another side note we were very happy to participate in the event yesterday for the HRAPLOS Biology Essay prize Open science can help reimagine biomedical research the article is already out via this early access link with a new scicomm group at Hackuarium we made a little 1min to help explain how molecular diagnostics work wdyt of this more vids to come,,looking forward to the project spotlight session today see you there here is the registration info the party was a success with not only our original sponsor there but also the president of the conseil communale of our local village Ecublens CH Thanks for this followup probably the upcoming project spotlight event will be the next thing to get people aware about to be confirmed but perhaps already set for 17November awaiting a response along with eventually putting together a splash page website for the project Are you in the slack We generally communicate in the nucleic acid amplification channel merci beaucoup do you need a JOGL slack invitation,It seems likely that omicron doesnt make extra problems for Corona Detective at least even if we have some regional mutations we follow shown here using the NEB Tool and logistics of batch production are still unresolved Looking forward to seeing whether attending the AfricanCDC meeting 67 December will help in some way Hope springs eternal that sense will prevail and the pandemic lessen,,We have to thank everyone for their help and are hoping for the next Proof of Principle batch to be a success so we will learn as much as we can even if it only becomes more useful for the next pandemic Homebrew enzymes in Corona Detective may soon also become more realistic will let you know more when we do We made this figure to help explain how the method works with the quenched fluorescence Just realised I had not shared it here already thx Chris Happily we have had some positive results with wild saliva samples as I call them so we think we have already seen omicron with Corona Detective too whew this also adds a sort of sequence specificity that helps avoid false positives btw as highlighted in our peerreviewed article,,We have exciting news not only are the next PoP orders made for tubes to finally go again to Ghana and Sri Lanka but Kathrin and I will be attending the Engaging citizen science conference 2526April in Aarhus Denmark with demos and a poster around our work to be presented Finally we will meet in real life after getting to know each other via the JOGL slack and this project I will attach a pdf with my abstract here and hope all goes smoothly hi everyone how come this space does not show up in searches of jogl,vive open science hardware yoopi the latest mastermix components are on their way to Canada for the freeze drying thanks to our colleagues in California our Danish community lab friend ChaNel the little pink maker got to join in with Kathrin there as covid finally caught up with me on an spring break weekend in Switzerland Thats do it together research for you viva open science if all the qc is good tubes will be also coming with me to Paris for some open science hardware tests from Frans super masters project hoping Guy and my Hackteria colleague Urs can make it but happy to know Fernan is already set to be there,The PoP came from Canada on Friday and passed QC There is gorgeous quasr signal and negs stay negative for 2h Both a 200 copy control and covid case samples came up within 30min We are GO Here is the presentation on this for JOGS tomorrow Fran will present his latest hardware work too Sadly could not make the hardware meeting in Paris in the end but look forward to learning more about their week and wrap Also really hoping Clment might help with his co for the shipping to Ghana From Hackuarium might not be as easy to get through customs P More DIT ahead,,got more interesting results with the PoP batch yesterday Here are two conclusions 1 this PoP is stable for at least 7 weeks at ambient temps up to 35 degrees daytime temps here in Switzerland a few times and 2 virus in a weakly positive by antigen self test the day before collection saliva sample can be stable untreated for more than 6 weeks at 4 degrees Surprised although maybe others have data on this On Monday I hope to do some of my first tests of Swiss clinical samples blinded with some PoP strips that are also at room temperature in our community lab no air conditioning If all goes well I may get to do the 200 positive100 negative necessary for most regulators Awaiting news from our Ghanan colleague too,Excited about joining in for more open peer review and hope people like this idea of checking out DNA damage in their own inner cheek cells,,should we start using this more esp as we think about leaving twitter and facebook behind Happy to announce our next micronucleus workshop to be held on 21Jan2023 at Hackuarium Here is the meetup link for the event If you want to run one in parallel virtually or actually please let us know Its most fun to DoItTogether thanks to all the peerreviewers looking forward to our next micronuclei workshop nice there are arguments about not leaving the other social media to the nasties but the debate is still unresolved Lets see if more than you start posting Chris P and me,,Not only will we use the last of our PoP batch tubes this Saturday during a mini workshop held before our subsequent special micronuclei one thank you reviewers of the SOPbio challenge but another 96 reactions are already off for Fran to take to Chile where they will be used in more tests Especially interesting will be to see how Fernans labs homebrew enzyme batches will compare to tubes freezedried in Canada with commercial enzymes Results of our clinical validations here in Switzerland will be put together with these latest and previous tests and those of Sammy in Ghana by spring we hope Will it all help in response to the next pandemic hopefully not of yet another corona variant We just have to take it as far as possible Thanks also to Ali and Zeph who arranged this last PoP and all the team yoo hoo others keen We have protocols in French English and Spanish so far as our SOPBio grant is supporting this at least half has been sent they say to Hackuarium we are super grateful and hope more international peeps will join in too 1417h CET Please send me a note if you have any questions putting one of the 8 tubes at 35 degrees now in its little sachet as shipped ordinarily so it will have at least 72h to mimic harsh environmental conditions It is in an evernote expt for the moment P From Saturdays miniworkshop before the super SOPBio micronucleus one amazingly results were basically identical tubes from the frig vs the ones kept at 35 actually the positive control came up a bit faster somehow in those but the side by side shows the dry pellets stay very good All the results from Germany Ghana and Chile where there are still another 96 reactions to be run from this PoP apparently to be done with Brazilian colleagues said Fernan will come together probably as another paper depending on the teams opinion We have one more strip of 8 in the Hackuarium lab to run hopefully before the end of the week,We had a great in person workshop here at our community lab and we were also happy to present something about it all at Biosummit6 last weekend Here was the presentation and please see slides 35 Ill attach one pic here Thanks again for the SOPBio support The last set of 8 tubes here was again perfect especially as all the saliva samples were expected to be negative and were Hoping to get more great info after our colleagues in South America and Ghana finish their reactions too If anyone else would like to do this protocols are in our wiki and we could also organise other even at distance workshops It was presented with thanks also at Biosummit 6 Here is the slide deck see esp slides 6 and 7,,,,,,,,,

833,,,,,,,,,,Im looking for data andor publications on the association of 19nCoV SARSCoV2 with HLA alleles It is an extremely critical piece of information for understanding the cause and course of the pathology And at some point hopefully controlling the death rate of this disease Do you know who I may contact that could answer this question So far nothing has appeared on this subject in present publications Do you have any information on this subject or can recommend someone who does Finally past articles have shown a direct correlation with HLAB4601 and severity of disease caused by SARSCoV Are these results reproducible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

948,,,,,,,,,,Ive been reaching out to The Cleveland Clinic via my father who used to practice there Hes hitting up his network to get us access to both a Pulmonologist as well as a Respiratory Therapist from the clinic to advise and hopefully lend their names to the effort as well as ideally the name of The Cleveland Clinic to this project which will advance credibility and make fund raising MUCH easier Will keep everyone updated Hello everyone New to the project my name is Ben I am currently in touch with an expanding circle of professors at MIT about this subject and they perceive the need and are interested in pursuing this We are in the very early stages of discussion but it is highly likely that we will frame this as a Challenge to student body teams in Engineering Programs around the globe with a centralized Open Source design repository Undertaking an effort like thisto really be effectivehas to address a number of far reaching design criteria beyond the device itself which already will have to be adapted for local demands available supply lines and resources Our ultimate aim will probably be to put in place all of these parts along with assembly team instructions and sourcing information so that if needed local teams led by Student Engineering teams who are already familiar with the design concept and specifics can lead on site manufacturing These may take some specialized knowledge to produce parts of and students are ideal for the purpose becausewithin engineering programsthey already have it and are unikely to go down as a workforce as hard as people progressively older or less healthy I have not looked through your documentation yet but will as soon as Im able The academic effort is in what I would define as lets get our shit together and do this Its important but efforts have not yet formalized I will update you as I receive updates and see if the community wants to centralize here or on an institutional platform It would seem this community is largely based in Europe Is that accurate This project and members interested in participating should remain associated Dont shut down because of Umbulizer and earlier efforts there was another MIT version done ten years previous This will have to undergo a fair amount of redesign and thought for supply and production chains and we will also need to wargame out actual hospital and national emergency reserve supplies of ventilation equipment as best we can In some cases countries have 10s of 1000s of units in storage for this sort of emergency Obviously designing for those regions becomes less of a priority as the issue shifts to staffing for them My suspicion is we will be designing mostly for Africa and the Middle East and possibly South America Please stand byI will be back in touch with as much information as I can as soon as I can Ben Christophersorry for the slow reply Ive literally been on the phone nonstop as the US situation has been evolving in CA and MA and there haveunfortunatelybeen clusters beginning among the people I have been speaking with Let me find your Slack Workspace and Ill onboard myself there Happy to help with the organization and coordinationits what I really do best anyway along with outreach interfacing teams and front facing messaging What is the link to the Workspace Not the general invite to Slack but the workspace the existing one asks me to sign up again and I already have like two dozen workspaces lol or just email me at btreuhaftgmailcom ty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1192,,,,,,,,,,Dataset Description In response to the COVID19 pandemic the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID19 Open Research Dataset CORD19 CORD19 is a resource of over 29000 scholarly articles including over 13000 with full text about COVID19 SARSCoV2 and related coronaviruses This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up Call to Action We are issuing a call to action to the worlds artificial intelligence experts to develop text and data mining tools that can help the medical community develop answers to high priority scientific questions The CORD19 dataset represents the most extensive machinereadable coronavirus literature collection available for data mining to date This allows the worldwide AI research community the opportunity to apply text and data mining approaches to find answers to questions within and connect insights across this content in support of the ongoing COVID19 response efforts worldwide There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid increase in coronavirus literature making it difficult for the medical community to keep up A list of our initial key questions can be found under the Tasks section of this dataset These key scientific questions are drawn from the NASEMs SCIED National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicines Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats research topics and the World Health Organizations RampD Blueprint for COVID19 Many of these questions are suitable for text mining and we encourage researchers to develop text mining tools to provide insights on these questions Prizes Kaggle is sponsoring a 1000 per task award to the winner whose submission is identified as best meeting the evaluation criteria The winner may elect to receive this award as a charitable donation to COVID19 reliefresearch efforts or as a monetary payment More details on the prizes and timeline can be found on the discussion post Accessing the Dataset We have made this dataset available on Kaggle and are periodically updating it from its source To learn more and access the latest copy of the dataset you can also go here The licenses for each dataset can be found in the all sources metadata csv file Acknowledgements This dataset was created by the Allen Institute for AI in partnership with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Georgetown Universitys Center for Security and Emerging Technology Microsoft Research and the National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health in coordination with The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Dataset of 29000 scholarly article including 13000 with full text about COVID19 and related coronaviruses CORD19 A Kaggle challenge for the Natural Language Processing community En Italie limpression 3D a sauv la vie de patients atteints du Covid19 500 masques Decathlon transforms en respirateurs grce limpression 3D Emergency mask for hospital ventilators In recent days we have been contacted by a former head physician of the Gardone Valtrompia Hospital Dr Renato Favero whove got in touch with Isinnova through a doctor from the Chiari Hospital the health facility for which we were manufacturing the emergency valves with 3D printing process Doctor Favero shared with us an idea to fix the possible shortage of hospital CPAP masks for subintensive therapy which is emerging as a concrete problem linked to the spread of Covid19 its the construction of an emergency ventilator mask realized by adjusting a snorkeling mask already available on the market We analyzed the proposal together with the inventor We contacted in little time Decathlon as ideator productor and supplier of the snorkeling Easybreath mask The company was immediately willing to cooperate by providing the CAD drawing of the mask we had identified The product was dismantled studied and the changes to be made were evaluated A new component was then designed to guarantee the connection to the ventilator We called the link Charlotte valve and we quickly printed it using 3D printing The prototype as a whole has been tested on one of our colleagues directly inside the Chiari Hospital connected to the ventilator body and has proven to be correctly working The hospital itself was enthusiastic about the idea and decided to test the device on a patient in need The testing was successful Weare reiterating that the idea is designed for healthcare facilities and wants to help in realization of an emergency mask in the case of a fullblown difficult situation where is not possible to in find official healthcare supplies Neither the mask nor the link are certified and their use is subject to a situation of mandatory need Usage by the patient is subjected to the acceptance of use of an uncertified biomedical device by providing a signed declaration Whereas the effectiveness of the project we decided to urgently patent the link valve Charlotte Valve to prevent any speculation on the price of the component We clarify that the patent will remain free to use because it is in our intention that all hospitals in need could use it if necessary We decided to freely share the file for the realization of the link in 3d printing Unlike the respirator valve the link is easy to make so it is possible for all makers to try to print it correctly Healthcare facilities in difficulty will be able to purchase the Decathlon mask here the link and get in contact with 3d printers who could make the piece and provide it We clarify that our initiative is totally nonprofit we will not obtain any royalties on the idea of the link nor on the sales of Decathlon masks Below you will find Document to be signed by the patient for the use of the device in an emergency situation Link to the page of the Ministry of Health which explains how to activate the emergency procedure for compassionate care Video instructions on preparing the emergency mask once all the components are obtained stl dwg and step files for 3D printing We can provide further support and further details to healthcare facilities and makers who want to make the connection if necessary This device is not certified It is recommended for those who want to use the documentation to replicate it to avail themselves of the collaboration of specialized technical personnel for the realization and supervision of a doctor for the use It is absolutely inadvisable to replicate it if you do not have such skills Isinnova declares that it releases the drawings logics and any other intellectual property rights relating to Charlotte valve device is released free of charge provided that it is NOT used for commercial purposes En Italie limpression 3D a sauv la vie de patients

1338,,,,,,,,,,Ive been checking the 3D drawings and I think the cam is difficult to produce without specialized equipment such as CNCs There should be an extra engine for redundancy taking into account the purpose Im going to work on the cam and if I get a drawing with value I share it here is a simply proposal for the cam Just get from gears from local supplier cut it and screw it to the arm Tiago follows common gears in the market and cutting solution ATTENTION the components are not optimized On my personal computer I have difficulty drawing I will need some time to get a working and matching assembly The attached files are only to give an idea Here is a suggestion width a redundancy motor and independent if one fails the other keeps working and materials are much ore easy to getproduce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1363,,,,,,,,,,I saw a link on hackaday were folks were encouraged to work on an open source ventilator A search took me to a page Pandemic Ventilator Project which linked to here I saw that an idea for using a large blower and servo valves was postulated It triggered an idea that maybe the dyson blower could be repurposed since it meets a lot of the criteria for a turbine blower Available low mass high speed high flow rate high pressure AVE tore one down on his youtube channel and it looked like it might meet criteria I should have introduced myself I am an electrical engineer with graduate work in controls and biomedical instrumentation I have various CNC machines I have refurbished or built a 3d printer and a new DLP printer I am in the midwest US Im good with out of the box ideas and prototyping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1526,,,,,,,,,,Merci tous pour rpondre prsent et un amical bonjour tous les nouveaux membres Nous sommes encore en phase dexprimentation Personne ne matrise vraiment la plateforme mais je vous invite vous prsenter dans feed avec le types de vos contributions possibles domaines de comptences expertises matriaux matriel Il serait galement utile de savoir dans quelle mesure vous pouvez diter le projet et sur quelle partie Si vous ne le pouvez pas contribuer directement dans le pad en description dans l propos Ajoutez des besoins ides solutions ressources Et signaleznous votre disponibilit pour devenir ou non administrateur Mr Bidouille a cr un discord dentraide Maker Le groupe facebook en anglais du projet JOBL Helpful engineering Cest vrai que le projet initial a mut et maintenant sest largi aux autres besoins comme ceux auxquel ce feed en franais souhaite contribuer Plus je navigue sur le net dans les diffrents groupes forum de bonnes volont plus que pense que crer un projet de documentation structure des initiatives en franais pour les non anglophones est utile Je pense que nous pouvons documenter nos veilles et faire des ponts entre personnes et groupes de profils diffrents Et nous communiquerons avec les ttes de ponts des diffrentes initiatives Nous avons besoin dadministrateurs et de membres actifs Signalezvous et contribuez Pad du groupe discord Aprs une nuit de navigation dans les diffrents groupes forum de bonnes volonts plusieurs besoins se font sentir Sur le groupe Franais dentraide 3D ils commencent trier les propositions mais dans tous les cas y compris dans le Discord de Mr bidouille ce qui semble manquer le plus cest les besoinsdemandes prcises des Hpitaux avec cahier des charges Et ensuite un moyen de crer le lien permanent entre soignants et makers pour coconcevoir de faon optimise Donc je pense quun des trucs les plus urgents est de crer un canal de communication avec les urgentistes et les soignants sur le front via des tiers pourquoi pas personnel administratifs des hpitaux enseignants assurant la garde de leurs enfants Quelquun a une ide de lien dinteraction localement de plateforme privilgie pour lancer un appel Twitter avec un ashtag custom Une plateforme professionnelle Au quotidien dans lhpital sur quel app les personnels sont le plus souvent Estce que a vaut la peine de crer un canal spcial ou un forum ddi Lutilit majeure serait pour linstant cest de pourvoir remonter les infos du terrain les valuer trier et dispatcher pour les valoriser et valider rapidement des solutions La documentation est en ce sens fondamentale Une documentation structure des initiatives en franais pour les non anglophones Mais le framapad nest pas adapt Cest trop lent et pas assez robuste Une ide pour le substituer autre que googleDocs Quid de la coordination des initiatives Nous avons besoin dadministrateurs et de membres actifs pour nous aider organiser la veilledocumentation et tenter de coordonner les actions pour rpondre aux besoins Signalezvous et contribuez Des volontaires pour devenir administrateurs Un premier besoin exprim par un urgentiste de LA aux US qui pourrait aussi tre pertinent ici crer une appli un canal de communication entre mdecins autour du Coronavirus en remplissant 2 exigences minima avoir un moyen de vrifier leur statut de mdecin et prciser leur spcialit leur permettre de garder lanonymat ce qui compte ce sont les contenus Une sorte de forumapp professionnel en temps rel pour permettre aux mdecins danticiper les problmes et de bnficier de lexperience des collgues sur autre zone gographique On pourrait y rajouter une catgorie ouverte aux makers pour la coconstruction de solutions avec les mdecins Voir cette discussion Si vous tes dveloppeur etou connaissez des gens qui peuvent contribuer sur ce point cest le moment Formidable Merci pour vos contributions Ce qui serait chouette maintenant cest de commencer essayer de les documenter de faon organise ici dans le pad Google le framapad est instable et dans les commentaires des besoins du projet jogl correspondants ou ajouter des besoins si ncessaire Lefficacit de cette veille sera la curation organise Si vous avez plusieurs liens partager essayez si possible de les classer dans le corps du texte de votre post comme a fait Vivien Je vais tcher daider sur ce point de mise jour des contenus sur le pad mais plus on sera nombreux moins ce sera chronophage ou pas Merci vraiment Des volontaires pour devenir admin Une spreadsheet remplir avec vos moyens machine publi par le groupe fb maker contre le covid Nhsitez pas rajouter vos moyens de fabrication Une initiative internationale via Google form autour de la remonte des infos et des besoins et lorganisation de rponses On pourrait sinspirer de cette mthode dans un premier temps pour crer des formulaires faire remonter les besoins identifier les experts en biomcanique machinerie et fourniture mdicales Qui veut contribuer en crer la version franaise Une initiative internationale via Google form autour de la remonte des infos et des besoins et lorganisation de rponses On pourrait sinspirer de cette mthode dans un premier temps pour crer des formulaires faire remonter les besoins identifier les experts en biomcanique machinerie et fourniture mdicales Qui veut contribuer en crer la version franaise Pour confirmer ce que le technicien de laboratoire biomdical voquait plus bas Stphane a trouv un article plus fouill du maker italien lorigine des valves imprimes en 3D et il dit grosso modo que la presse a exagr tout a que sa valve nest pas rpliquable et quil doit faire face un certain nombre de pb et cest pour cela quil ne partage pas ses fichiers En outre limpression 3D na t utilise qu des fins de prototypage et les valves dfinitives ont t produites avec un procd plus industriel A ouvrir dans Chrome avec loption traduire Malgr tout je pense quil pourrait quand mme peuttre y avoir moyen de mettre les makers profit Pour

hier soir nous sommes plusieurs avoir compris quil fallait peuttre arrter de chercher substituer par impression 3d des lments de machines mdicales ultra spcialises dans des procdures dlicates dans un environnement contagieux sur des patients fragiliss Mais nous continuons de penser aussi que la communaut maker open source peut aider sur dautres besoins des soignants tant ceux qui sont dans les hpitaux que ceux qui sont dehors libraux ehpad sos mdecins brancardier ambulanciers Voir le post de Jessica En ce sens le plus urgent reste denquter sur les besoins des personnels suscits et de crer des cahiers des charges pour chaque item fabriquer Essentiellement du matriel de protection dont la pnurie se fait dj sentir Jessica a list des exemples dans le contexte US mais il faut garder en tte que les pnuries seront diffrentes en fonction des rgions et mme des hpitaux Notre force est de pouvoir ragir localement et sur mesure sur des besoins spcifiques tout en documentant pour permettre aux autres ditrer et de ne pas repartir de zro En gros gagner du temps par la documentation et la coordination mais tre proche du besoin local Cest la dfinition mme des fablabs on peut dailleurs mobiliser aussi les dcoupeuses laser ou cnc ou brodeuse numrique estce que rouvrir un fablab pour raliser une petite srie pour les soignants nest pas une cause suffisante de drogation officielle Comme le rsume si bien Stphane chacun concentr sur le local en terme de besoin dfinir identifier faire agir Le rseau pour trouver la solution son problme local en terme de ressource dev si besoin fichiers design rcuprer Nous sommes en train de rorganiser les pads dans le sens de la meilleure documentation possible pour cordonner les efforts de tous les groupes Facebookdiscord et autres et permettre de documenter les projets de fabrication items par items entre groupes de volontaires et anticiper la monte en charge des donnesconnections avec des souspads partager sur les rseaux Et surtout il faut mettre en place des systmes de contacts et de dialogues entre les soignants et les makers alors que les premiers sont noys et nont pas le temps daller sur internet Plusieurs hypothses utiliser les administrateurs des hpitaux qui sauront comment et quand trouver des moments dchanges monter un espace virtuel dchange ddi qui fonctionne avec un dictaphone dailleurs des mdecins urgentistes aux US ont voqu le besoin de dvelopper une app qui leur permettrait dchanger entre eux anonymement autour du coronavirus mais en vrifiant au pralable leurs credentials et spcialits En open source pour que chaque pays puisse se lapproprier dans sa langue Si vous connaissez des dveloppeurs du libre cest le moment de leur glisser lide Partager dans les rseaux On pourrait avoir un canal spar dans cette app pour quils exprime leurs besoins aux communauts Maker localement une autre ide de premier contact via les instits de permanence pour garder le personnel soignant via les famille des malades pour leur donner une chance dagir aussi de leur ct face au manques constats Sur le groupe Open Source Covid19 Medical Supplies gt Masques faciaux durgence mdicalement accepts en priode pandmique Design link

nous ne postons pas beaucoup dans le feed nous continuons la veille collective et la documentation rigoureuse de solutions DIY au plus prs des exigences mdicales en fonction des besoins spcifiques exprims par les hpitaux Nous avons toujours besoin de veilleursdocumenteurs pour remonter les informations pertinentes et les validations par lusage Contribuez NB les masques font lobjet dun pad part Voir le lien dans le besoin correspondant et dans le pad gnral Et surtout regarder dans les besoins de ce projet et nhsitez ajouter vos rponses ici Ajouter aussi vos ides de besoins Cette exprience de coconstruction solidaire fonctionnera avec la participation de tous Bonjour Emma le projet Helpful Engineering est un ambitieux projet de RampD autour dun respirateur en DIY en fabrication rplicable facilement Ici il sagit plutt de venir en appui de faon beaucoup plus modeste grce aux impressions 3D de pices de rechanges et la fabrication de petit materiel utile et de protections aussi pour les soignants en coordonnant la communaut des possesseurs dimprimante 3D et de makers Une sorte de chaine de solidarit spcialise repair caf destin aux hpitaux Avec un inventaire des initiatives et des solutions trouves Le CHU de Genve a par exemple un de ces respirateurs en panne Un des membres de ce projet se propose de se rapprocher deux pour dlimiter leur besoin En agrgeant une communaut suffisamment ractive en documentant et en mutualisant les ressources et process on pourra peuttre aider les soignants au pic de la crise Lide cest dtre lcoute des besoins des soignants et de mettre disposition une communaut maker pour trouver des solutions adaptes avec les moyens du bord Ce projet va dj exiger le partage de beaucoup dinformations Lagrger au projet HelpFul Engineering risquerait de noyer les contenus des 2 projets Par contre nous allons crer des ponts bien sr Pour ce qui est des masques oui bien sr il y a effectivement beaucoup de liens dans le PAD et cest vrai que toutes les plateformes sont lentes Je vais tcher de recopier les liens ans ce projet Le Framapad est down Ds quon rcupre laccs on essaye de migrer vers un outils de collaboration plus robuste En attendant jai fait une copie de secours ici Merci Emma Merci Caro Ajout aux contraintes de cahier des charges des masques dans le pad On progresse Si vous avez des ides concernant les moyens de faire remonter les besoins des soignants toutes ides et interlocuteurs concerns bienvenus Ensuite il faudrait se rpartir les tests de protos avant de les faire valider par le personnel mdical Super Vivien javais commenc documenter ta liste dans lle pad Google Je les ais ajout ici Si tu trouves un meilleur support de documentation pour optimiser et la documentation et la lecture ce sera chouette aussi Merci Vivien Merci Juliette Thanks Thomas amp Emma I think we could use guidance advises and ressources on biosafety restriction to help validate some of the prototypes Prevention repository Would it help to have medical expert involved in our project Merci de contribuer Olivier Malheureusement les makers qui commentent disent que cest trs faible comme tutoriel et que celui du CHU de Grenoble est plus efficacecomplet Le but de ce projet tant de classer les contributions des makers tu peux complter le pad existant On est en train de travailler la cration doutils complmentaires et de tenter damliorer

1894,,,,,,,,,,Pretty cool project Is there a cash prize associated with this initiative I saw this call for innovation from the French Gov If you are responding to a prize I would have other questions about how you deal with a collaborative project in the presence of such incentives which can disrupt the collaborative fabric of the initiative If there is no cash prize associated with this I suppose some manufacturers will take the design produce the masks and sell them to the government I am all for open source but Id like to know if this group has thought about the effects on collaboration of the idea that someone some day may profit from this collective effort I dont want to open a philosophical discussion now when everyone is heads down trying to get things done But if there are issues related to my questions in this community perhaps I can help diffuse them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2427,,,,,,,,,,Hi Im a mechanical engineer based in switzerland I can provide designmodelling with Solidworks parts and assemblys or even design new devices according to specifications in my free time So if there is anything i can help with let me knowthings getting nasty here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2553,,,,,,,,,,I have developed a design for a ventilator that is pneumatically driven which I can make available to you The idea is to develop a 3D printable design that could be mass produced anywhere with access to a 3D printer and some basic supplies to complete construction The device would be cheap enough compared to conventional resources as to be considered disposable I need some assistance with the technical aspects of the design which are beyond my capabilities with a goal of releasing an open source file to be used anywhere with anticipated demand In keeping with the spirit of this project I have attached a link to a PDF of my design My goal is not to make money off this project I want to save lives A ventilator design like this takes a continuous flow of gas measured in Lmin and divides it into an inspiratory and expiratory phase for the patient The percentage of oxygen the patient receives is determined by the mixture of medical air 21 O2 and 100 oxygen which we have mounted on the walls of our treatment rooms The minute ventilation for the patient the total volume of gas inhaled per minute by the patient is determined by the combined flow rate of medical air and oxygen The tidal volume is the amount of gas inhaled by the patient with each breath and there needs to be a controller built into this design to control this variable Once the bellows has filled to supply this tidal volume the controller will need to change the setting of the switches to deliver the gas and allow for expiration When the bellows empties the expiratory switch needs to flip to allow for the patient to exhale The respiratory rate is a function of the tidal volume and the minute ventilation The bellows is weighted the weight on the bellows will determine the IE ratio the ratio of time allowed for inspiration relative to expiration because a heavier weight will allow the inspiratory phase to be completed more rapidly in compared with the passive expiratory phase PEEP or positive end expiratory pressure is the resistance to exhalation provided by a flow restrictor on the exhaust port of the circuit and is a separate device which we have on hand I do not have the technical expertise to design the switches or to CAD draft this design which is why I have reached out for assistance The PEEP valve is standard and can be attached externally The check valve is a one way valve like this The switch controller would need to be designed by an engineer The one adjustable setting would be the tidal volume which triggers the system to flip modes All 5 switches would need to flip when the bellows fills to the tidal volume the expiration switch would need to flip when the bellows empties The goal would be to print enough of the device that someone like me could assemble it from the printed components and other readily available supplies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2748,,,,,,,,,,,Dear team members thank you for joining the Breezy project I would like to invite you to the project slack channel projbreezy,We have made a great progress with Maros this weekend Breezy has made its very first breaths watch it Preview of the custom syringe pump controller being developed Breezy now has a new control panel Six knobs allow easy setting of important parameters like tidal volume PEEP FiO2 etc The lastest firmware update supports reading of the pots and some parameters actually take effect already You can find the progress on github We keep working hard The electronics board design is finished we can go on implementing a compact mechanical design This board has been designed to have everything a syringe pump needs all in one including buttons LCD buzzer motor driver incremental sensor force sensor status LEDs and battery charger The current board dimension is 120 x 86 mm,Check out our latest progress All the controls are working now however we still need to do a lot of refinement The tidal volume is is often overshoot so is the maximum pressure But the rest of the controls work quite well but need more testing There are no alarms yet that will be subject of further development as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3176,,,,,,,,,,Currently putting together a seed group of individuals and research institutes Join this project if you are interested in this stage of development Aiming for first project video call in first week of April Follow the project if you are interested in this stage of development Contact me for anything else kavbkentacuk WA 447869258854 CRITICAL PROJECT UPDATE Having established that the UK government will be rolling out mass testing and not just 35 million tests as originally noted the urgency of this project is no longer there In light of this I will be approaching each person currently or planning to be involved to archive our work for the future and reconsider what our collective next steps are Suggestions 1 Database development Any work done or agreed so far to be documented on an opensource platform such as Github so it can be revisited in the future at the appropriate moment This includes the fuller steps of mobilising the nongovernmental medical infrastructure in the UK and the first digital step in development with a map of independent hospitals 2 Open to conversation with related projects in LA and Hawaii Momentum for a zoom conversation has not been reached at this point Considering the change in circumstances the plan for zoom call is paused until reorganised by members of related projects 3 121 conversations have been held with different potential members of a starting base for this project A zoom call is planned next week Considering the change in circumstances the plan for zoom call is paused for those still in the process of being invited 4 The core people This accelerator will help define moving forward If you are interested in participating together as a team get in contact Outputs Project so far Ideally in the form of Github accompanied with text document Momentum of base team of social scientists engaging in opencovid19 I will personally maintain some contributions to the opencovid19 project such as the Project Review programme Meeting 27032020 In attendance Charles Laura Avi AGENDA gtsummarise first iteration gtwhats the next iteration of the project gtwhy are we doing this in the first place gtaction points for whats next ACTION POINTS Project Management Avi led gt Share first zoom call gt Update JOGL slack and potential members gt Timetable next project zoom call Friday 3rd April 1130 EDT 1530 GMT 1630 CET Project Development gt Draft updated project pitch Charles led gt Approach developers regarding the development of databasemap Avi led gt Begin identifying similar projects Laura led There is no codebase Thats the first challenge What does a code base template look like and what ways are there to fill it in Well I mean I am sure there is a codebase for different things but I have yet to access it beyond website frontends like the links in the Need callout Ok I got first codebase what do you prefer to communicate on Slack PMDM,Community Initiatives to Implement Testing for Covid19 All over the world governments are focussing their efforts on flattening the curve spreading out the number of Covid19 fatalities over a longer period so a healthcare system is not overwhelmed But how do we also shorten the curve and avoid a prolonged period of enforced isolation and social turmoil Our aim is to design a process to identify local resources which can implement new opensource designs for mass testing This form of mass testing can end the threat of the virus and the harm caused by a prolonged lockdown Using the UK as a case study we have identified promising designs for a variety of testing methods and we intend to map both the resources and facilities in the UK capable of manufacturing and implementing these methods The project then aims to connect the capable organisations into an initiative to implement testing on a far larger scale than what has been proposed so far by government This project is part of the JOGL Opencovid19 Initiative and a research partner of KISS Kent Interdisciplinary Centre for Spatial Studies We invite people to join our 2nd community call to contribute to the project Friday 3rd April 1530 GMT 1630 CET Project Update 1 The core team have been working on scenario building what the future implications are for teh different wasy C19 diagnosis is socially embedded More new on this soon This has become the main work of this project coordinated through other means than slack Project Update 2 The most appealing version of this projects original idea is to build and promote platform cooperatives This would help coordinate dispersed manufacturing capabilities for medical supplies and testing production Note We have removed the hashtag in the title No Boomer Left To Die It was intended to invoke the idea that the coronavirus does not equally affect everyone It largely targets a subset of the population This is not entirely of the boomer generation but a significant proportion And actions should be made in that light However based on feedback we have received we recognise that it is a distraction and maybe unnecessarily contentious We are keeping these notes for the purposes of learning from this prototyping process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3255,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Our preprint is finally published on MedRxiv Apologies for some extremely late updates from our project We developed a nasopharynx specific RTLAMP primer set as an internal control This primer set spans exonexon junctions and is therefore mRNA specific Through the summer we ran some trials by shipping our cartridges to France and Chile The results were promising in terms of stability of the reagents In these trials as well as in the lab at the Oakland Genomics Center we observed some issues with nonspecific amplification products leading to some false positive results To mitigate these errors we decided to sacrifice the sensitivity of Bst 30 for the specificity of Bst 20 We made up for this new lack of sensitivity by swapping out our primer set from the NANB set published by NEB at the beginning of the pandemic to the NM set by Broughton et al In this respect the two JOGL projects ALERT and Corona Detective have been converging the NM set was QUASRified by Guy Aidelberg from Corona Detective We have furthered our collaboration with Fernan Federici and Cesar RamirezSarmientos groups at the Pontificia Universidad de Chile We are particularly excited to switch out proprietary enzymes for those in the public domain We also developed a magnetic wand for easy sample transfer into our reaction cartridges We also continued to present our project to various groups and events such as the gLAMP consortium Global Community Biosummit and the Reclone Network Ps Additionally The ViralALERT team was also chosen as a finalist in the XPrize COVID19 Testing Challenge All of the information outlined above can be found in our preprint posted below now being considered for peerreviewed publication gunna take a shot at variant discrimination via RTLAMP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3288,,,,,,,,,,New theapeutics for sarscov2 anyone Starting a project outsiders approach of coronavirus treatment scheme Most therapy research is devoted to the well known aspects of coronavirus vshost cell interaction Potentializers of antivirals are needed as none in their 20 years history has been strikingly effective While emergency has put an emphasis upon already approved drugs as priority candidates for covid19 we think and daily updates confirm until now that structureactivity AI driven screening models have failed to identify sound but yet unknown modes of action As Chinas first approach upon testing any candidate supplied by a potential provider proved very disappointing there is a good chance we could succeed although there is no guarantee but why not We wish to gather a task force open minded with specialists of epigenetic PD at intracellular level of membrane efflux or penetration autophagy macrophages and dendritic cell activation membrane stability and H or K exchanges researchers focussing on LEE roles whatever antiinfectious anticancerous background specialists of NFkappaB system PKPD understanding would definitely be a plus although our small group is ok on that area Thousands of protease inhibitors of ATPase dep H or K modulators are not available to an outsider point of view as big pharmas are focussed on this promising approachIt is the same with statins that never ever have found a rationale for use while making blockbusters Nevertheless our idea membrane fluxes are key to viral multiplication and to escape of cytokine control which is a general consensus is leading to the review of potential key role of drugs already approved in the potentialization of hypothetic therapies We have identified at least two pairs of candidates that besides fitting those consensual and up to date analysis through different pathways in relation to pore forming conditions are very likely compatible with most if not all present hypothesis and even theories elaborated specifically after coronavirus sarscov2 contact We believe that if emergency context does not allow for elucidation of complete work upon dimer selection of NFKB involved in the various processes mentioned above there is a very good chance that our approach would equal or outperform all noise made around the old CHQ whose toxicity is incompatible with its use in ICU patients It is essential to our point of view that participants are well instructed trained harsh criticisers hopefully positively oriented but we accept and welcome those of the community who are keen to say hey Sir youre wrong whatever slang theyd use PROVIDING they explain why and suggest another option whatever this option would be within the project scope sentences such as I have used chloroquine when I was 12 and happened to be travelling to Africa are prohibited as it clearly indicates that you have not checked the difference between 100 and 600 mg dosing neither tox models of renal impairment in mice nor the outcome of chinese study on 30 patients We are working on the rationale of an outsider approach that is scientifically sound and believe that from existing toolbox no single miracle product will help but potentialized chemotherapeutics will providing we are flexible in therapeutic protocols so they are constantly adapted to patient individual history and stage of the disease as it is notorious that antiviral treatment should start early enough but not as preventatives to avoid resistance induction of course depending upon the mode of action and later stages are under the control of cytokines storm that should be avoided Looking fwd to reading from you soon Be prepared in the case of success that great mouthes will spoil you of your contribution especially that druggable targets will be assessed with patent soon to expire drugs and thus the manufacturer and the people who have missed the train could become very aggressive thereafter our significant advances We are expecting support from specialists of epigenesis onset and control drug penetration silica models humanised mice models specialists our friends at Pasteur and vicinity are overwhelmed at present clinical pharmacologists KIND REGARDS johnPtaf from Paris lockdown Any foreseeable next meeting for the information about MT B I have tried to forward to you a recent paper about alzheimers that she cosigned so some of the coworkerscould also be of wise help It may be interesting for you see authors affiliation in expanded view If not send me your email Yes youre right Sorry for lag time It is also well known from Woodward chemistry a long time ago chloroquine synthesis that toxicity being an issue Raoult talks of 600 mg p day not 100 mg together with the macrolide azithro that spiramycine would replace as well I would suggest 1you do a quick search with plant screening pharmacol on Pubmed NIH You might cross with plant chemicals of barks plants of geographic interest and knowledge 2 thereafter contact spcialists such Maria Teresa Batista she might be locked down in Lisboa or very busy in STP where internet is not always available but shes likely to give you better directions 3 as the disease knowledge increased I suggest you might as well include free radicals scavengers containing plants with immuno modulating properties serious papers not junk that is on internet as the target besides ACE and tmprss on cell membranes is the h ATPases dec the keys to transmembranes flow that controls in turn various intracellular systems including direct key immune processes AND potential resistance to the virus regardless the specific target the drug is aiming at thus those would act as potentializers of any effective drug Moreover I understand that traditional medical experience is very deep in plant association and preparation 4 all the best Wishing you success and Stay safe John JeanPierre,,Can you develop a little further wed like to

4432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Progress Report on epiLAB in vitro domain We ordered the ecoli codon optimized BstLF fragement and cloned it into a pET14b vector Transformed in DH5alpha 3 colonies showed no mutation on CDS and expression cassette as far as the cassette was sequenced Expression in BL21DE3pLys yielded 21mg100ml of culture with a purity of 85 estimated by SDS gel For Purification Alex Browns protocol was followed and a NiNTA of 15 ml was used Validation of the DNA LAMP test model SARSCoV2 Nprotein targeting primers taken from Zhang et al 2020 with Nprotein plasmid provided by a befriended laboratory showed positive endpoint detection but not a good result with gel electrophoresis Awaiting the test model from Rachel Aronoff of CoronaDetective to try it again before starting realtime evalutation and specific activity measurements Expression with NiIDA columns less expensive than NiNTA showed high impurities implicating these columns are not to be used without polishing with this protocol However there was a update on the purification protocol with highly optimized buffers Will test NiIDA columns again with this one and reevaluate Progess report on epiLAB in silico domain Extensive research on DNA polymerases literature was done prior to setting up the infrastructure We managed to get a grand for the high performance computing cluster in Darmstadt Germany and some sponsoring from AWS On the HPCcluster we will screen for possible mutational sides with the Rosetta Commons framework We set up the infrastructure already and relaxed two suiting structures of BstLF Interestingly they showed a higher stability without complexed ions which contradicts experimental data This finding needs further assessment before we use this structures for mutational sampling In parallel we set up a sequence database for mutational sampling amp the AWS infrastructure for Gromacs stability assessment MD simulation runs,,,,,,,,Progress report epiLAB Rosetta Homolgy Modeling creates non usable structures eg the catalytic traide is broken and there are some IDP structuremotives that disrupt the integrity of the model We concluded this approach as not in relation to production costs Soon we will apply for a new computational grant at the supercomputing cluster in Darmstadt Germany We will remutate the residues to the wildytype sequence Moversalgorithms for enzyme optimization are set amp trial runs on other structures were successful Benchmarking in Wetlab is set and awaiting insilico output,I guess for our approach iTASSER unfortunately is not sufficient We want to mutate single residues afterwards so we need a high resolution structure to start with The problem with our enzyme structures is that about 50 residues in all pdb strucutres app 10 of whole protein are mutated you often need that for eg crystallization purposes So we thought why not try comparative modeling It failed obviously D We try a different road Will all be documented though at some point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4488,,,,,,,,,,,,Lots of progress happening on this project over the past couple of weeks I have a new design and prototype of a reusable version of the respirator that has been specifically designed for first responders but can be also be worn by healthcare workers It won the COVID19 Maker Challenge from Challenge America and the VHA Innovation Ecosystem and the project will receive additional support Next steps are finalizing the sizing materials construction and then testing the new version for fit breathability and fluid protection I started 3D printing faces as fit models to test whether my mask fits on multiple facial dimensions and sized since I am working in isolation and dont have access to other humans A lot of safety gear is designed for young white males because of old 1960s data gathered from measurements of participants from the US military We are an even more diverse nation now and over time our faces have changed In 2003 NIOSH scanned and measured heads from 1000 participants women men multiple races and nationalities merged this with anthropometric data from thousands more and weighted it according to US census data The result of this was a series of 5 standard head forms meant represent 95 of the American population I turned the surface models into 3D printable versions The one pictured is a size small,,,,,The full set of 3D printed headforms that I used as models for patternmaking details are in my previous post Ill be presenting the Basic Respirator project at the Veteran Health Administrations Innovation Experience on October 29th Im excited to share my ideas and project with the VHA network and hopefully garner more support for the project The conference is virtual and registration is free thank you so much Definitely looking for feedback and to collab on both the device and AR app if anyone wants to get in touch I think there may be potential for this beyond respiratormasks too,,I shipped a batch of respirators for user testing last week Half of these are sewn from waterproof Cordura and the others are 3D printed from PETG I will post the results from fit testing here It was an extra challenge in keeping my workspace sterilized and sanitizing all of the materials and parts prior to shipping The 3D printed components were soaked in 3 hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes and the fabricheadbands were washed in detergent and hot water heated to 60 degrees celsius I tried steam sterilizing the fabric versions with an Instant Pot pressure cooker based on a study from the Cleveland VA Medical Center and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine The Cordura fabric I used to construct the masks survived but the heat bonded neoprene tape I used to seal the seams and binded edges began to peel off I purchased some better tape and will test it on another day Here are the links to the study regarding steam sterilization of N95 respirators with a rice cooker I am looking into options for testing and thought Id write a post about the US FDA criteria for face masks surgical masks and surgical N95 respirators Regulatory guidelines in the US for the last category are very strict and the FDA classifies them as class II medical devices Manufacturers must obtain NIOSH certification Premarket notification 510k and follow Good Manufacturing Practices An EUA can also be issued This document outlines the testing criteria based on the categories I listed above For any surgical N95 respirator design to satisfy basic criteria it must pass a qualitative fit test Bitrex aerosol test bacterial filtration efficiency testing determines how effective the devicefilter is at trapping particles Air exchange testing the measured pressure drop across facemask material fluid resistance provides an adequate barrier against bodily fluids and flammability The last criterion can be bypassed with adequate labeling I dont believe any open source designs have cleared these hurdles even at the EUA level though a few are still trying If you know of any please comment below As I learn more information about the testing protocols and how to conduct them I will document and share,,I redesigned the filter enclosure to reduce airflow to allow the filter to better trap particles N95 filters rely on Brownian motion for smaller particles under 03 microns since the pore size of the filter is larger than that It forces the particles to travel a chaotic path and they become trapped within the fibers I used Rhino and Grasshopper to write a centroidal Voronoi tessellation algorithm that generates the pattern It is denser in the middle where the mouth is and I suspect that this should distribute airflow more evenly across the filter to eliminate hotspots and require less filter material Waste reduction is an important aspect of this projectThis has not been tested yet though I printed this on a Form 3 SLA 3D printer The second photo is the design in Rhino and the Grasshopper script used to create it I love generative design for the aesthetics but I am thrilled when I can use it for a functional purpose Parametic House and the Grasshopper forums were a big help in learning how to write this algorithm The project has been gaining ground the past 2 months Tomorrow I am pitching it to a group of investors accelerators and innovation leaders during a startup funding event organized by the Veterans Health Administration and a nonprofit called Challenge America Their support has been phenomenal and theyve been promoting my design to garner more interest and support My main contact at the VA and I were interviewed on TV last week on a nonpartisan news program about the US federal government to promote the event You can watch it here I have a few more updates to share later this week but in summary Ive got a team a plan and am seeking funding Lab testing is underway and I have some changes to make to the design after consulting with experts I arranged for initial testing on the respirator and the materials that I am using in the construction Advanced Functional Fabrics of America led by MIT is sponsoring it and the Fabric Discovery Center at UMass Lowell is the lab running the tests themselves We will be looking at filtration efficiency pressure drop and resistance to fluids and blood to see if it meets the minimum NIOSH and ASTM standards for respirators and surgical masks There will be many more posts regarding testing amp design considerations and Im documenting everything with the aim to publish a guide about it for future respirator designers,I submitted an application for Round 5 of grant funding After I finish the first rounds of lab testing Im planning for a UX pilot research study with healthcare facilities and looking for feedback and potentially collaborators If you are interested or know someone who might be please join the slack channel projbasicrespirator or get in touch Heres what I am looking for 1 Guidance with turning this into a more focused study with potential for publication I suspect that disposable N95 respirators dont fit many people very well so they are not providing 95 protection But there are a few other problems Id like to investigate and my proposal covers a lot of ground I am guessing this is a common mistake with new researchers 2 Avoiding bias when collecting data Ive done UX research previously and its very easy to introduce bias unless you hire an outside provider to facilitate Even then people generally want to be nice when evaluating new products 3 Decontamination testing I would love to put on a lab coat and learn how to work with pathogens safely but I understand this is a serious undertaking with a lot of safety issues Some feedback on this aspect would be great Or maybe theres a way to prove that the device can be sterilized through already published research The photo above is a technical drawing of the design I drew most of it with Adobe Illustrator Its difficult to show all of the details in a photo since I put a lot of effort into making the design look as minimal as possible,Ive been planning the healthcare pilot these past few weeks and this image is a highlevel roadmap of the tasks I plan to complete Ive divided them into two phases and healthcare facilities can choose whether they are interested in participating in one or both phases My goals for Phase I are to document issues with current solutions relating to respirator design fit and usage I will interview front line staff that have worked with COVID19 patients and ask them about comfort safety and whether the respirators they wear have impacted their ability to do their job I will also interview custodial staff and administrators to determine the burn rate for respirators and the costs for disposing them Concurrently I will continue lab testing to ensure the devices meet regulatory guidelines identify appropriate methods for sterilization and determine how many times the mask can be reused During Phase II I will measure the faces of front line staff and record their dimensions for data collection and to determine their mask size Id like to ship at least 50100 functional prototypes with filters I will test the donning and doffing procedure compatibility with glasses and other PPE and perform an AB test between the new device and their current solution Ideally Id like to have them wear the device throughout a typical shift though not around infected patients and have them complete a survey afterwards Then I will analyze the data and determine the cost per use environmental impact and fit comfort and safety of their current solution vs the new design a hrefuser6393spanspanRobert Reada yes 01 is fabric and 11 is a magnetic fastener for quick donningdoffing but also working on another less costly option 10 is another fastener to adjust the size of the harness I didnt include the parts in the photo above due to space constraints but I have them listed in the documents section in the pilot document Thanks for asking,,,Its been awhile since Ive updated this project but Im still making progress and have some recent developments Id like to share 1 Ive modified the test plan a bit to focus more on fit testing specifically and published a working version of a test plan that I will continue to update 2 Im working with another developer over the next 3 weeks to develop v10 of the mobile AR app to do facial scanning and measurement Id like to collect as many high quality scans as possible to determine a the accuracy of the app b whether healthcare workers are wearing the correctly sized respirator and c collect feedback on its usefulness in fit testing 3 I am still looking for volunteers that want to help with research specifically to provide feedback on study design and data analysis It can be as little as a quick zoom call or you can stay on for the duration of the study Get in touch if you are interested and would like to help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5029,,,,,,,,,,,,COVID19 is ideally detected with RTPCR and ELISA In this project mass spectrometry will be used for detection of SARSCoV2 viral proteins The method is expected to be sensitive accurate highthroughput in nature Moreover it will be independent of expensive reagents and labeling reactions thus reducing the costs significantly,,As we all are gradually emerging out of our homes this is an attempt at summarizing literature that used mass spectrometry for CoVid19 study One of the papers that recently grabbed my attention popped up in my social media feed The published work could detect SARSCoV2 proteins from oral gargle solutions of CoViD19 positive patients positively identified with RTPCR The gargle solutions 750 L were collected and protein precipitation carried out with acetone 1 mL treatment overnight at 20C The samples were then centrifuged supernatant discarded and the protein precipitate was first solubilized in digestion buffer Glycosylations were removed from the protein precipitate with PNGase enzyme The protein precipitate was subsequently digested with trypsin for liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis Chromatography separations was performed on nanoHPLC system C18 column coupled with Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid instrument Thermo Fisher Scientific Further details of the experiment can be found in the link below The group was able to identify nucleocapsid proteins from the CoVid19 positive samples Although this work was carried out on only three samples the salient features of the work stand out i Diluted gargle solutions as samples mass spectrometry is a sensitive technique and identifying SARSCoV2 proteins from noninvasive samples as gargle solutions provide immense scope for developing diagnostics ii Scope of translating workflow as methods are gradually developed for identification of proteins the method has scope for translation to highthroughput platforms such as triple quadrupole mass spectrometers I hope this method finds more use in future Please find the link below for the paper Weekly Digest 2 Last week we looked at how mass spectrometry can be used for SARSCOV2 identification from gargle solutions This week we delve into host response with mass spectrometry for CoVid19 infection The work has potential for biomarker discovery and for developing targeted assays in future The proteomics study was carried out in UK and the patient samples were procured from Germany Serum samples from CoVid positive patients with different severity WHO 37 were compared with general baseline population from Scotland age matched One of the key aspects of the study is partial automation of the sample preparation with liquid handling systems including protein digestion and desalting It is significant since it reduces the exposure of the technician to the samples and most importantly increases throughout of the overall sample preparation process In addition the developed LC method increases throughput while using a shorter gradient flow The proteomics MS method used here is data independent acquisition DIA which involves subjecting all the peptides to MSMS The advantage of using such a workflow lies in getting a broader protein coverage including less abundant proteins in a single analytical run The study identified proteins involved in inflammation complement activation and blood coagulation as some of the markers that change markedly in WHO 37 grades Namely serum amyloid A protein SAA and apolipoproteins show a marked increase and decrease respectively as the severity increases This is a promising start for future proteomics and biomarker discovery studies Please find the link for the paper below,Sharing an important article link that was recently featured on Nature Biotechnology Twitter feed The most important thing MALDI MS based detection of SARSCoV2 is possible Will provide an update on the paper next week Weekly Digest 1 6th July 2020 As we all are

5942,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hi Nico Great to hear from you Funnily enough we too wondered about using yeast for expression given the global brewing capacity in microbreweries but were starting in Ecoli Bst enzymes are open sourced from ADDGENE or via the Ellington lab in Texas Presumably you would need to clone them out of the existing plasmid for Ecoli expression and into a S cerevisase carlsbergensis expression vector Im not a geneticistmolecular biologist so dont know if there needs to be codon optimization or anything else to switch from Ec to Sc Very interested to see how this might work so please let me know how you want to move forward with this Hi Nico Sounds like a plan So you are going down the route of only partially purified cellular extracts rather than the biochemists conventional purify to homogeneity approach If that can work without carry over of specific or nonspecific PCR inhibitors and DNasesRNases then that would be fantastic or there might be a halfway house that is a simple NiNTA column Does anyone recall seeing a paper describing an alternative to NiNTA not just the swap to NiIDA but a completely different resin I seem to remember coming across it on my internet travels but cant find it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hello Training data set exchange between researchers Can you ask University of Cambridge to share their training data with you They promised to do so while collecting samples in their Cov19 Sounds App Appstore or play store see Hi to Jan I saw you asked EPFL I just realized they are cooperating and exchanging their samples with Cambridge Every one can contribute samples with the app on play store or App Still I think diversity is needed as time runs out Predictive power to severeness of possible covid19 infection Please look at as it describes evidence that PostCovid or severe course is related to irritable immune system in undue shortening This is prevalent to some researches in a high percentage of EU population like 17 but totally individually in manifestation Common problems are lung problems like asthma but hematoma from light mechanical stress due to changed coagulation and similar problems as well I can tell from own observation that the real hard part will be to distinguish between irritated immune system alone and one additionally suffering from covid19 as the triggering event for MCAS can be anything and symptoms then can be quite the same up to dry coughs fibrosis of lung O2 deterioration and wakeup gasps at night Perhaps one should ask people upon donating coughs to tell if they have allergies and other symptoms hinting on irritated immune system and ask them to describe in hindsight if symptoms were related to other immune system overreactions or were indeed the beginning of a Covid19 infection Compute Power Shared Has anyone thought of creating some form of distributed computing environment Perhaps the newer hardware with AI extensions could help out older models by donating compute power while charging while watching device temperature Stethoscopic Mode Can I contribute to extend recording to structureborne noise with mobile phones This would be the attempt to do more than a stethoscope can do with almost any smartphone I would like to introduce the idea to combine lowfrequency data from the accelerometer MEMS chip with sound Here I would like to select from the different microphones builtin plus the external one on any cablebound headset The headset is offering the possibility to have live preview on the headphone for the user and its microphone can record breathing sound while the smartphone is in stethoscopic mode and could not catch the users breath while pressed to some body part for simultaneous recording Im not sure if an app has access to many microphones at once in android Since MEMS accelerometers range up to a few hundred Hertz it may well be worth while Recording stethoscopic sounds I did so by creating or using some cavity around the microphone hole If no cavity is there from some soft case like the hole for back camera and microphone one can cut out some O structure from an antislipmat for deposting small things in a car One side is stuck around the mic hole the other is made nonstick with some covering like rubber from singleuse powderfree glove an can make skin contact I used Voice Record Pro by BejBej Apps click Advanced and in record engine advanced mode then on level check where you are able to select one of the 3 microphones under input source and having cable bound headphones attached to switch on Audio Monitor in Level Check Then I pressed the microphone to the skin until the air gets enclosed in the cavity and could hear eg heart beat or lung noise or noise in of throat breathing hiss through the bones around the paranasal sinuses and could detect inflammation from damping of high frequencies The iPhone8 will not be well suited as its microphone introduces some artificial noise when the skin is coming nearer to the microphone as if the MEMS regulation algorithm is disturbed by picking up PhotoAcoustic relaxations I had excellent success with an old iPod touch 4 and a good headphone hearing the heart beat of my unborn child but can not reproduce it as I can not find the monitorbutton in the app I used it as a microphoneamplifier to just listen This is essential as it helps to find the proper place and good contrast for some piece of recording and to hold it still without rustling and swishing Upon interest I will check all kinds of mobilesapps combinations you suggest to test for valuable results with while to process through ai I think that if the user would be guided in detail where to pick up body sounds one would have a much more deeper and better to analyze but in the first place faster to train data set Im trained in telecommunications rather than deep in programming but I will cope in both given some precise target I even could think myself in diving into 3D printing of TPU Stethoscopic Adaptors to produce highquality recordings with proper fitting clipons for the most prevalent smartphones Perhaps even for the little mics in the cable bound headsets that smartphones are shipped with as some recording engine could do audio recording with the external mic while using the acceleration sensor for deepfrequency simultaneously recording of body vibrations See you Andi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Once upon a time 3 years ago for almost 15 years I also searched for something that is cheap and available and effective and safe and transparent protected agains structural corruption Call it Humanistic Intervention I formerly called it democratic but I see people erect their fences when hearing this crippled and tortured word Suggest other labels please Important is the boolean logic AND ampamp chain So apply these conditions to face masks and shields You certainly make them affordable and cheap The illusion of safe and effective for me was blown away with the negative efficacy of all those measures also masks Of course crisis management should be all about risk compensation If you have some immunicompromised I later develop ideas what potential seeder caregiver and recipient patient or vice versa can both do Without citing lengthy papers for them see below 7 reasons for that the argument runs The less antigen non viable or sterilised parts at best we exchange the less trained antibodies we have the more ill we finally become and the more we postpone endemic state as also by ALL measures and the disinformation of the mighty aka fear porn and propaganda gt directly reducing nK thus prohibiting trained innate antibodies thus preventing sterilising immunity thus herd immunity thus endemic state this chain shall hold up for all ADE capable pathogens as known since 40 years or so the only viable immunity is by mucosal trained innate antibodies preventing the need of Bcell based antibodies through deep infection It includes all detrimental measures like WHOapproved CDCpropagandized inverted hygiene rules just so distorted that effecting enhanced spread in waves at home most infections take place Noone except Prof KlausDieter Zastrow early on proposed something antiviral topical or systemically or in the air for the poor humans infecting their beloved ones 15m is a lie Droplets fly 3m and hover in tge aur needing 40 SECONDS to slowly sink down and ONE droplet is 100 infectious Sneeze to elbow is a lie 70 of droplets just get reflected and infect AROUND THE CORNER Problem of face shields as well Protection of self or others Sneeze cough into masks is a lie The masks always have places around the skin contact line where they do not fit smugly THERE droplets can fly in and out Do the test by droplets by spraying with medium pressure inhaling and exhaling it in a dark field setting if you like with UV light and UV marker nasal spray Cool hygiene rules would state Masks do protect only 1 without reliable statistics IF you use ine di not feel safe Do PRESS the mask to your face by both pointing fingers and thumbs without gaps if you sneeze or cough or got showered by droplets also close eyes meanwhile 40sec Immediately after placing droplets and after 14 hour of wearing DO spray your maks by inorganic antiseptic sprays CIO2 200700ppm I2 stab 100ppm NaHClO800ppm H2O2 013 or saNOtize all working perfectly for mucosa sprayed or inhaled Also any NO generator in hospitals would end any respiratory and if higher and below NOAEL dosed by systemic symptoms from any infection by onecelled or smaller pathogens holding true for all inorganic antiseptics mentioned above Always spray breathing in to nose AND throat and one under the tongue as 15ths start in saliva glans 45ths in respiratory RING and only 1 for nonsmokers directly in nose or tracheal part mostly of the lungs even this accessible for 1 day to 10x hefty breathing into lungs a puff of inorganic spray as droplets based upper respiratory care It will not reach alveoli so even 700ppm CIO2aq is useable to good results Get a real inhaler and eg NaHClO like Plasm Liqui mouth rinse solution 800ppm from pharmacy or dilute some with dead sea or stone salt water from your dentists supply asap if feeling some infection sliding down from throat to vocal cords and down Back to masks See gt160 Studies with real settings and not just particle counts Follow the links and Alice intk the rabbit hole I observed my reality was multiple times turned over and now I dig into the philosophy of the ckncept of reality and read Mattias Desmet The psychology of totalitarianism as a bad case of cognitive dissonance prevented me from seeing selfevident truths shining up my face And watch the videos from the conference of humanistic hippocratic physicians and researchers there archive them I now resort back to I know that I know nothing and SaintExuperys Listen to your heart well the little pronce said one can only truly see with the heart And I attribute every being in our society of humans some role we play and the sum of roles make up the story of humans Right now this story is very distorted and the ATTENTION we give to the bad things even rises the detrimental effects It would be necessary to do magic by deliberately NOT doing Magic as in Terry Pratchetts Equal Rites To deliberately NOT be part of moloch Be part of something humble like humans See Moloch Defined My contribution could be Virtual Masks that work gt90 Here a paper for 100 that of course was severly critiqued strangely enough fir formal things like consent of participants and not the key point of having measured 100 protection by 5 times a day one drop of glycerine with 006 lvermectin solved in it See My opinion is that especially for classical mask cases like surgery a virtual mask combo spray from inorganic antiseptic longterm acting additive like essences like cineol and prebiotics like xylitol one can top the protective effect of masks if accompanied by also spraying inhaling with the patient and for surgery regularly or continuously nebulising or spraying the open wounds with inorganic antiseptics and while surgery letting a dry fog eg hypochlorite nebuliser called room disinfection machines with admission also for people staying insides the room run They are programmable to room number size document usage and even could make a big disco floor safe like 500m Just get informed consent you may use one any time Include Side note You could walk out with less viable pathogens and may not infect others for up to the incubation time If you find this disturbing please leave now Technology of NaHClO nebulising was used in military hospitals in Spanish flu and in bunkers ventilation to prevent spread of respiratory illnesses civilian buildings thus valid and admitted procedures in archives Still not every earth inhabitant has access to some nebuliser to protect or treat the lungs also systemically effective in proper dosing see Dr Thomas Levy An athome treatment protocol using H2O2 I suggest 3Dprinting clever lowpressure nebulising heads Air pressure could then be used from bike air pumps balloons as stored compressed aur like tires or old gas bottles but air has to be filtrated like in a pipe filled with mask cloth and carbon to catch out eg oil aerosol from technical pumps I have a Cn inhaler battery driven pearlde crap as inner nebulising insert that ducts up fluid by Bernoulli underpressure to air nozzle point was not able to withstand 100C from cooking water needed for disinfection though manual stated I shall cook it using a setup to nebulise particles with a median of high diameter thus low energy or pressure need and then separating them cleverly by spinning the flow by a vortex structure insides the head of 4 fanlike blades but steeper angle so the bigger droplets get sorted out by centrifugal force and drip back into the inhaling fluid The median of emitted nebula is then the nice 5 m range of alveolar wellresorbed particle size range I hope I am not overloading your capability of adoption to the reality perception of fellow people having come a far way from maskfetishistic vaccinated and measurescompliant obedient citizen like me to some awakened but unsuccessful promoter of true interventions that shall be humanistic at least selftransparent especially See the top 5 points here Tell me what you think To make use of this treasure is as easy or hard as to open the eyes of the ones working together to recognise narratives we incorporated to be not part of our true reality but rather being implanted foreign objects we should develop immunity against Please help me to compress this to 3 little lines AHASprayAntiseptic eg,,,,,,,,

6473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Project update Day 1 The core agent interactions have been implemented in R and preliminary results are in agreement with the existing Matlab simulations The total computation time is slightly longer for the R implementation within seconds which is to be expected as the simulations rely on various matrix computations In the coming week we will be continuing to test the R simulations with our existing results to verify the implementation and we will be looking to optimise our computational methods to reduce computational time particularly for the large agent simulations JWM Project update Day 2 Today we continued to implement features from the existing Matlab programme including adaptive testing and delayed testing scenarios The R simulations have been heavily tested to confirm agreement with our existing results We have also made a start on the UI for the webapp and it is in the early stages of its design JWM Project update Day 3 All features of the existing Matlab model have now been implemented into the webapp The UI is starting to take shape and we have trialled the application using the server Computation time on server tests are satisfactory under 1 minute for smallmedium scale simulations Next we will be implementing an Export results feature to allow users to conduct the own analysis from simulation results Project update Day 4 5 The webapp now has the feature to export the simulation results and parameter values to an excel file to allow for extended analysis by the user To ensure the application is robust we have started to stress test the alpha version with the help of members of various TAG subgroups The server was able to handle largescale simulations from several users at once Project update Day 7 We have implemented a dropdown style UI to partition parameter groups to improve usability The summary results previous simulations are now stored in the results table to allow for direct simulation comparison without the need to export the results after every run We have also included a feature that updates infection parameter values using the most current data supplied by the Welsh Government Project update Day 8 The software now employs a disclaimer on startup outlining the guidelines of its use and the responsibilities of the user In addition we have now have contact information and source code links directly on the UI to improve software maintenance and transparency We also include an information section which briefly discusses the model data and results of the software however we recommend the user read the reference text before using the webapp Project update Day 9 Today we focused on UI development polishing off how we represent simulation results and colour schemes for both light and dark mode We also spent some time organising files in preparation of repository uploads for the original Matlab and the current R source code,Project update Day 15 We have optimised the simulation code which now improves scaling with the total number of agents specified The exported results has been organised to be more efficient with the ability to export all the user loaded results from the summary table We have also included the option to name simulation runs to keep track of results for AB testing To improve accessibility each plot now contains a dropdown box for captioning Project update Day 19 The applet is now ready for public use and can be found at Latest developments 1 Immune agents can now be seeded into the population to represent agents that have been fully vaccinated or recently recovered from infection 2 Information buttons have been attached to all parameters to give parameter definitions and tips to how they might influence results 3 Any simulations stored in the summary results table can now be plotted in isolation or against each other to allow for visual comparisons of simulation results Absolutely We are finishing up the fulltime development this week with the first version currently being polished off and sent out for feedback The project is completely open source with all the information on our GitHub repo so we welcome anyone who wants to extend the project to get in touch We have just about finished the first build of the applet now appending a few minor adjustments and so we will be releasing the link soon Until we have feedback from policymakers the community we have no tasks left for the project However as my JOGL funding finishes tomorrow I will no longer be able to dedicate significant time to this project so any help from the community with later updates to the application would be great I will be posting the required features to be implemented on GitHub page as we get feedback All the code for the app is opensource so anyone can add to it as they please but if someone does want to work with us please get in contact to help with organisation The code is written in R and uses the shiny library for webdevelopment so we particularly welcome anyone with prior experience using both tools No time limit for the app though it does have a usage allowance each month This allowance is very generous so I dont think we will run into any trouble there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

275450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Epidemium GeoStatus Meeting this Saturday morningnoon Nov 6 2021 At Google meet me archeology done Ready to help with this knowledge done Collected a reduced list of important data sources here that now need to be investigated Document placed on github and updated there github has more chances to remain available in 5 or 10 years given the number of projects there that people care about PS I am not part of that website I am just amazed by it and what it implies for health vs covid Meeting starting now Saturday November 6 2021 10 am Paris time I started with Air Pollution On p115 or I see air quality standards for SO2 NO2 O3 PM25 Lead PAHsb Benzene Arsenic I will look further for these If one person is willing to costudy this with me you are welcome otherwise many more persons are similarly needed for the different identified carcinogenic agents and IARC monographs Hello would you be available this Saturday 6 nov 2021 doodle The meeting will then be on google meet 10 am tomorrow Paris time Pol I let you adjust the NEOSOsiris part To find OSIRIS data in English In the google doc other projects file you will see YfX of much higher interest to you I think cancer risk fair pollution Of course it first needs to be checked that it is needed compared to scientific article reading Pascal may know but I would guess it will be Would you use R or python to set things b TOUS LES DEPARTEMENTS on the right click OK AIR ET EMISSIONS ATMOSPHERIQUES on the leftgtAI04 NO2 gt Gnrer But MyDataBalls is perhaps better perhaps it contains this and much more I didnt investigate it It seems to me you can create a JOGL ODE project just on it I will be happy to help from time to time a bis I see that the data is actually available since 2013 from the website of the producer There you can choose one of 13 pollutants a date and click to download the data You would need to analyse the GET or POST request to loop over dates and pollutants to retrieve all the data while waiting for a few seconds between two consecutive requestions it will take very long 365 x 4 seconds x 8 years x 13 pollutants 3600x24 2 two days of execution time data should be stored as soon as it is downloaded but this data is then very useful I guess to explore the relationship with cancer AFTER the things above less important or in parallel if someone else wants to focus on this it is possible to retrieve cancer mortality risks at a largecity level in France in addition to departments you may refer to gt valider gt 2setToGrandeVille gt 5 set to a specific type of cancer However i one has to find the population in these large cities but this shouldnt be difficult with a simple google search for each of the 13 cities with the reference listed at least the url ii one has to scrap this website to retrieve all that is needed Here is a scrapper for this website developped some time ago at department level rather than city level so to be adjusted import codecs

to 2018 here you download it once search for Donn to see the link X ideally for every department and year at which Y is given we would like to have pollutant values for the same department and the 15 years before For X I had given you this link but I see that it is only for 2021 and I read that historical values should be soon available So two possibilities a you take this X and suppose that it is was the same in the past years so that you just do Y2018 fX The trouble is i that you have only a few departments on the Y side so it is unlikely you will get something stable with so many variables clearly not with an oldfashing model like logistic regression or linear regression perhaps with a random forest that uses bagging it can work ii I see that these X files do not contain a column department so merging X and Y requires to associated things like MetzCentre with a department the data for that needs to be found or it can be done manually to searching for the department associated with these locations as there are only 364 locations The reference at least the url to associate locations with department should be listed and any doubt should be made very visible so that we dont create garbage in garbage out b or find a better X I would personnally look into MyDataBalls if not then in sources listed here Then I think a randomforest a regression method that can handle many variables and associated importance variable analysis might be sufficient This is I think something that a team could do so if with the ones in Barcelona you want to create a project If you are familiar with deep learning or have friends in Barcelona who are and want to be savy ideally all the Y values for a department and given year t cancer mortality risks by age gender body location would be derived from a few nodes a few in order to constrain the model to make sound predictions and not predict mortality by age randomly typically so the shape of the deep learning model is a bit like an autoencoder themselves derived from all X values for the department over the fifteen years before t and well as age and gender But such a model is very very long to calibrate A randomforest or XGBoost model should give a very good vision of how to use X to predict Y compared to the effort it takes This data part is continued in slack Here is how to register to the slack Hello Baptiste questce qui tintresse Je propose un point ce samedi matin pour ceux disponibles 6 nov 2021 doodle The meeting will then be on google meet 10 am tomorrow Hi Oscar perhaps the best is to join the slack to exchange more easily Register here to Slack We have mortality data by city and by year we are adjusting it by age and gender it can be considered as a mean a noise whose distribution we know and we have pollutants by city and measured many times during the day for years and we are collecting other geographic data gt I dont know if you think you can make good use of this R or python is welcome
